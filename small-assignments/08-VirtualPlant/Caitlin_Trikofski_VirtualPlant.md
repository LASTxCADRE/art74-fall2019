Virtual Plant Description
The plant I created is called a Ohutus Ring, its purpose is to show that an area is generally safe. It provides shade for fish to hide from predators, it serves as a home for insects and is used in calming products(tea, medication, scents and etc.). The flower grows like wildfire around lakes and is a mix of a Lily Pad and the California Poppy. It floats on top of water and is located in shadey, cool areas. It is connected to all of the other Ohutus Ring flowers around it and never stops being produced. The scent of the flower scares off large predators. It doesnâ€™t have a large impact on climate since it is hidden under layers of trees within forests. The flower originated from being cross pollinated on the border of California and Oregon. However, it has not been genetically modified otherwise.
