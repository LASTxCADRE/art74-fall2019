Name: Caelum Lily 

The Caelum Lily is an extremely large flower resembling a Calla Lily. Like any other flower, it generates pollen and nectar, but to a more considerable degree considering its size. The most notable feature of the Caelum Lily is its extremely high carbon dioxide intake compared to other plants, which allows it to generate much more oxygen that multiple trees combined. The Caleum Lily was developed by the XXXXX Biological Research Facility of XXXXXXX as a way to control and reverse the damage caused by the heavy Carbon Dioxide emissions left by human society. An unintentional use of the Caelum Lily is that if can also be used to terraform planets with large hamounts of Carbon Dioxide if plants are sustainable at that point. The Caelum Lily grows by planting itself or being planted by a firm source that it can grow off of line a vine, then as it grows, wraps around the firm source. The sources can include trees, poles, large rocks, and garden fences, along with many others.
