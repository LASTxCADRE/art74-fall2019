The plant I chose is called a Pitcher plant, I named it Trappy. The purpose of this plant is to trap and kill bad things
because it's a carnivorous plant. This plant can make the world a better place by eliminating all the bad energy from people
and trapping them as a punishment in a jail cell. Inside the plant has a deep cavity where it's filled with digestive
liquid so it can dissolve things. Any bad energy that enters the plant, it will distroy it so it will never appear again.
