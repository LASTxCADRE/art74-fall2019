Gigicus Ficus 

Gigicus Ficus preys on the nervous systems of all living creatures. It is a mutation of Gigicus Adinus, a genetically modified hallucinogenic plant intended to connect neurons in the brain to enhance overall function. The name Gigicus derives from its ability to make its victims giggle when inhaled. Gigicus Ficus, however, is the deadly extreme of its modified predecessor. Gigicus Ficus floats invisibly through the nervous system and can remain dormant for an indefinite period of time. The activating spore is still unknown. During initial growth, Gigicus Ficus begins attaching itself to the central nervous system of the brain. Victims first experience a sort of heightened euphoria but it very quickly subsides to a dull pain. Gigicus Ficus grows slowly, wrapping around the spinal cord. If left untreated it eventually can cause paralysis. The plant itself does not appear until the body of the host has died.
