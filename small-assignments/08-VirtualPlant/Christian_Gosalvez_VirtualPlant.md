Plant Name: Duplicilily

In an effort to create a new way to increase fruit-bearing plant reproduction, scientists accidententally created the Duplicilily.  Right as the flower was created, it almost destroyed the lab in which it was created.  This is because within the petals of a Duplicilily, there are millions of tiny spores that have the ability to duplicate the flower from which they came from within 5 minutes, using only a small amount of water.  Through experimentation, scientists have found out that the spores are capable of latching onto anything that creates energy, whether it be animals or other plants, or even sources of electricity like power lines or computers.  Due to these extremely dangerous tendencies, the Duplicilily is currently locked away in a lab to be reproduced, being carefully monitored so that its population stays in check.
