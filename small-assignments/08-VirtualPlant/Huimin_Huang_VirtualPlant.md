The plant I created is called "lotus flower and leaves", lotus flowers means Pure and elegant, clean and transcendent in Chinese. 
The purpose of this plant is to purify the world since our world is more pollution. The lotus flower lives in the water 
that is clear, without any pollution. Our earth is getting more pollution, if we don't start protecting environment, our 
human beings will destroy one day.
