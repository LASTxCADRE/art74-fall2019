Prollioyme is a fungus type plant that lives in the rainforest. However, it’s not the size of regular fungus. It’s also not the same material as a fungus. It’s body is stronger and tougher to the environment. It’s on a scale almost as big as Cecropia tree which grows to about 49 feet normally. It’s purpose is to take in large amounts of carbon dioxide and then exerts tons of oxygen into the air; due to its larger mass. It originally originated in the wild but was mutated in a lab to help it grow to a larger scale to function at a greater level. It lives mainly in the rainforest and areas that have similar climates. It grows prospers on the ground. Prollioyme connects and interacts with other plants through it’s roots which are not visible from the surface. The roots extend down and below the ground and communicates with other plant roots.
