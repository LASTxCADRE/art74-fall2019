    Through a series of arduous experimentation and modification of air cleaning plants, scientists were able to nurture the Convorto Blossom into existence. There are two species of the Convorto Blossom, *Fragria-Terra* and *Aqua-Purgare*. The Convorto Blossom's function is to cleanse the air and bring down pollution levels. The *Fragria-Terra* does so by absorbing air pollutants within itself and converting them into the seeds of plants that will produce further oxygen and clean the air. Usually, four out of the seven seeds the Convorto Blossom emits will plant Convorto Blossoms and the other three seeds will plant a single flowering blossom with a fragrant scent. The *Aqua-Purgare* works nearly the same as the *Fragria-Terra* except it absorbs ocean pollutants or toxicities in the environment, and must remain in the water to continue its cleansing cycle. The *Fragria-Terra* remains on the ground since soil is a key part of its reproduction process. The *Aqua-Purgare* usually remains on the sea floor but will drift towards more polluted areas of the sea similar to an Anenome. The Convorto Blossom allows other plants to flourish by cleaning the air and removing toxicities in the environment.
