Name : Rainforest Drip Tip



Give your "TECHNOBOTANIC" virtual plant a name and generate a descriptive utopian narrative around your imaginary creation (1-2 paragraphs). You might want to consider some of these questions for ideation and brainstorming:

What is the function/purpose that your plant is fulfilling?
What species of plants is it? How was it originated?
Has it been biologically modified or mutated by humans and technology? If yes, how so?
Where in nature does it live?
How is it affecting the ecosystem, climate or earth in general?
How is it connected to our World Wide Web network? How is it communicating through the Wood Wide Web with other plants?
Does it float/fly? Attach to things or live off of other existing plants/wires, cables, cell towers, etc.?
