This plant is called Eagianna, which is a mutated pitcher plant that was made in ABC Science Lab of XYZ University. It is a new type of pitcher plant that has prey-trapping mechanism featuring a deep cavity filled with digestive liquid. Eagianna's food are mostly small bugs such as flies or bees. Most carnivorous plants exist in places that lack of nutrients, however, this plant often grows on fertile lands. Therefore, by feeding itself with the nutritions from both the land and the victims, Eagiannas usually produce many leaves with big flowers. Its white flowers bloom with a very nice scent to attract the bugs, but the wall inside the flower is very slippy, enough for the bug to fall into the bottom of the flower - where the digestive liquid is. The acid inside the liquid will slowly absorb the victim, and turn it into nutrients for the plant. Overall, the acid in the plant is not dangerous enough to affect human, but it has a very nice-looking flower with a pleasant scent, so scientists are looking for a way to use it as a natural solution for reducing malaria and dengue rates that exist in country with many deadly mosquitos diseases.
