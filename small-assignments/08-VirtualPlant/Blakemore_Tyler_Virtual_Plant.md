My plant is a biologically engineered plant known as the northern star, this plant only blooms in the northern direction. Humans realized that technology would never last as long as plants would. So they decided to create a plant that would help people for years to come. It was designed to be able to grow anywhere, even the desert. It has deep roots that are constantly expanding and absorbing water, so much so that the northern star is able to give out its excess water to other nearby plants in need.
