Mauvophyta Macroalgae

This plant Lives on the surface of the Indian Ocean, and was altered in a lab by botanists and chemists to create a plant that would clean toxins and oils
that have spilled into and affect our Oceans. Soon it will spread and re-seed and be carried across the whole world. When toxins are found in the ocean,
the Mauvophyta macroalgae "Purple Seaweed" will absorb the toxic chemicals into its pores, and out it releases saltwater and purple mushy algae substance that falls 
into the lower parts of the ocean, and when eaten by fish, it tastes delicious and is able to reseed through the fishes poop.The plant does not need
sunlight to survive but nearly water and toxic chemicals to absorb. 
This Purple Seaweed floats and is very long, its roots are attatched to large rocks or coral at the bottom of the sea floor and edge, when the
plant detaches or experiences drought, the plant will release seeds to repollinte the area.
This plant works well with other ocean plants and creates a clean ecosystem for the Earth's oceans.
This plant is also helpful  in curing human ailments when taken in small doses.
