Plant name: Hederacota
   
   My plant is a splice between an ivy and a fungus to create a plant to absorb
the oil from the Earth from oil spills. The plant was created by humans after 
studying the oil absorbtion properties of certain fungi. Splicing these fungi
with ivy genes allowed the plant to absorb oil much faster and grow at a much
faster rate. The plant is also able to survive in most temperate climates, 
but unfortunately struggles in sub-zero climates. The plant is able to spread 
it's roots underground in order to soak up oil that may have seeped into the 
soil and put the ground water at risk. This allows humans to safely drink the
water in contaminated zones as well as help the local plant life flourish.
