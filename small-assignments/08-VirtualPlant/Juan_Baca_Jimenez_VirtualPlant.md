Blue Sunflower

The Blue sunflower grows automatically after a flower or plant is planted. Even works on trees and grass. The purpose of the Blue Sunflower is that is detects and indicates someone if the flower or plant is using alot of water or if it needs more water.
The flower itself is small but the roots are long enough to wrap around the flower or plant that you've planted. This helps detect the amount of water the flower or plant is receiving. The blue leaves faces up if too much water is irrigated. If the leaves faces horizontally than the right amount of water is being irrigated. The leaves faces down if water is needed for your plants/flowers or even your lawn.
When the leaves face horizontally, it grows seeds for birds to consume which helps improve their life span. The whole idea for this Blue Sunflower is so that we don't over irrigate our plants, trees, and our grass and waste a lot of water. The Blue Sunflower has been tested to the Plant-Biology Research Cener.
