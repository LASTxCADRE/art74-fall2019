Description:
I wanted my project to have the feeling of peace and warmth. I think the surroundings would smell nice like the flowers falling from the unique pink trees. My motivation behind this piece was that I've been enjoying a lot light pink colors lately mixed with greenery. The audience is supposed to view this piece as if they were standing in the same field among the trees. Lastly, I didn't have any influencers on this piece other than the fact that I wanted to do something with pink in nature.

Description:
There was no feeling that was supposed to be brought forth from the viewer of the piece but I think it does feel a bit happy and light. I wanted to have interactive drawing in this piece in the background. I didn't want to drown the piece in color so I limited the pallete you draw with. I got some inspiration from Leily when she showed us the demo. The audience is supposed to view this how they would a canvas. My only influence on this piece was the in class demo.
