Wonderwhirl

Created through P5.js editor and Atom

Wonderwhirl is a simple interactive image intended to create a hypnotic experience. When the mouse is clicked the pinwheel begins to rotate faster, growing outward in an attempt to envelope the viewer. New ellipses appear to create a never ending spiral. The semi-transparent pastel colors make it difficult to focus, adding to the hypnotic theme of the image.

The Portrait Sketch consists of elements learned in class as well as some experimentation with borders and interactive elements. The portrait follows a similar color scheme in wonderwhirl and both generate constant movement to maintain interest.
