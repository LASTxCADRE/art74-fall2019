## Description
Space shape is an interactive drawing. I was mostly trying different things and came across a stressed traiangle shape. I liked how it looked at different rotations. To me it looks like icicles or a futuristic desighn. My second drawing is a noninteractive 3D image. The shapes move in circles around the plane and the light reflects off of them. In the center I have a rotating cone and on the edges there is a square and sphere. I chose all pink, purple and blue colors to match the background. I like how the end result of the moving shapes centers and frames the cone in the center.
