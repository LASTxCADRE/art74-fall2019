Description: Becuase Halloween is around the corner I wanted to do something spooky for my project. Looking at all of the movements Mixamo had to offer I just knew with the sheer ammount of zombie movements I had to find some way to incorporate that. With other models such as the Ferris Wheel I decided to shift it into more of a Zombie land climax scene where the protagonist are in an amuzement park against a horde of the undead. Except instead of the protaginst used in the film I again merged it with something else I enjoy using foot soldiers from the hit video game Halo as the subjects. This gives me a great reflection back at my childhood since everything here can help to explain as to why it's doing what in the scenery
