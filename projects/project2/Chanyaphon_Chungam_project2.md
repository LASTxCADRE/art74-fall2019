Description:  

For my project I wanted to create a story about a lost astronaut trying to find their way home and stumbles upon a small garden in the middle of the cosmos. The mood of the piece should feel serene and almost like the viewer feels a little lost like the astronaut; looking at the small garden floating in space. Looking at it, I want people to feel calm. There’s no sound except just the vast universe. I really wanted to create something involving space because I’ve always liked the idea of it. But I wanted to add something else to it. So I combined space and plants, which are two things I enjoy.
