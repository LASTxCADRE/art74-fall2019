### Description

When I first thought of what I wanted to make, I wanted to build an island with full of sweets and cotton candy. My idea was simply to creat a world that exists upon the clouds, decorated with rainbow and unicorn. It's like a fantasy world that kids usually dream of, like a kind of wonderland. Working with the project 2 took me a lot of time to figure out what kind of world I want to make, and how I can convey my ideas with that much time and the number of models I can use. Overall, this is a small island floating up in the sky, filled with sweets and has a very dreamy essence. If i were able to escape from the real world, this is one of the place that I want to go to.
