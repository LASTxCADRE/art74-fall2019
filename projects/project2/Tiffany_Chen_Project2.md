Description

The story behind my creation is being trapped in your own feelings. It's hard to show your inner thoughts when you are not
close to other people. Expressing yourself could be a really hard thing to do thats why my person is inside a ball. From the 
outside, it looks really plain and it's hard to know what's going on. But if you zoom in, its like opening someone and getting
to understand their feelings.
