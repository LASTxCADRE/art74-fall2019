### Description
Bubble Gum Island rests just off the coast of Japan. A thick layer of fog obscures it from view and only a select few indigennous tribesmen know of it’s exact location. The place smells sweet and fruity from the gum tree’s aroma. Gum collects on the leaves as the sap mixes with the moisture in the air. The entire island is a bright almost blinding pink making it difficult to make out the gum from the rest of the vegetation. Special tools are needed in order to exract the gum from it's tree. 

This story is inspired in part by the Disney movie Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, where a young scientist invents a machine that “rains” food. The vibrant colors and textures represent a Dr Seuss-esque influence.
