Description: 

  You are surrounded by green. Cabbage litters your feet. The cabbage encapsulates you. 
You are being watched by the cabbage men. You have no choice but to submit to the power
of their leafy greens. The life of cabbage will be the only life you know. You can't help
but lose yourself within the Cabbage Caverns.
