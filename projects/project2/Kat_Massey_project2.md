## Description
  Oasis Island Motel is based on a fantasy place where a motel shows up in the middle of nowhere (the desert in this case), to whomever is needing most at that time. 
  Im basing it off of the illusion that happens when someone is in a desert ans starts to see and oasis of water and plant life in the middle of a desert but here it's real and appears to the person just for them, magically. It kind of reminds me of the Sword of Gryffindor (Harry Potter reference).
  I didn't have much else concept wise for this piece but i'm happy with how it turned out.
