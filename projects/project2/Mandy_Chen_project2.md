My project is insipire by the scene from the movie "Sprited away" there was like some werid statue and the father in the movie said they are the Gods of Japan.so I created a temple with a white fox in the center of it. My project smells like the fresh smell from the tress and the smell of the dirts. I input a temple bell sound in this project, because I think it will make the audiences feel like they are in a temple. There is also a cat beside the temple as a gurdian. The reason why I put the mountain behind, it's because a snow mountain will make the temple looks pretty. After I took the model to Sketchfeb to adjust it, it became a temple that has a sense of mystery. Afterall, I want my audience to experience a relax walking when they use the VR headset, when they are walking inside of the temple.
