### Description
My 3D sculpture is influenced by Alice in Wonderland, which is why I decided to include the playing cards and the well known white rabbit. I wanted my sculpture to be a surrealist peace because of the virtual reality aspect. I figured that the more surreal and odd the virtual landscape was composed, the more immersed the audience gets to be as they experience the artwork. As a viewer, my project imitates that wacky and surreal characteristic of the Alice in Wonderland universe and the sound that I chose, called "Psychedelic" completes the vibe of "wacky landscape". 
For the concept behind my piece, I wanted to create a subtle narrative, one that is more implied or open to interpretation. My piece relies heavily on background knowledge of the Alice in Wonderland story because of the way I chose to present my elements. In my work, I have an altered version of the white rabbit, the playing cards of the red queen, and a scaled version of the white rabbit's head all composed inside a boxing ring. One interpretation of this piece could be the struggle of the white rabbit to avoid the unfavorable outcome often decided by the red queen, which is commanded as "off with their heads". Although I want these connections to be prominent in the artwork, I leave the rest of the work open to the imagination of the audience as they immerse themselves in this backwards world.
