Description:
My idea behind this project was to create a sports world by implementing a soccer field, baseball field, and a basketball court. I added a terrain of mountains to bring out the idea of going hiking.
I included a soccer ball that is over sized that is placed over the soccer field. Also, I placed a basketall over the court, again it is oversized because I thought it would look interesting that way. Originally the ball did look like an actually basketball, but because I was exploring and playing with the edits on Sketchfab.com, I lowered the opacity and increased its glossiness and it aim to be a transparent glossy ball. I wanted to emphasize the idea and encourage to have an active lifestyle by playing sports, or exercising, hiking, yoga. Anything that will energize our minds and have a better connnection to nature and the outdoors.
