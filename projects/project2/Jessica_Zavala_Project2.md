Soccer Field/Complex

Medium :

Dimensions/duration : 3D Web VR

Attribution (burrow and tell) : Soccer  ball from poly, Soccer field from poly, Female figure from poly.

Basically my project smells like green,wet, fresh cut grass and has the sound of loud audience on the sidelines 
yelling and cheering with the sounds of the ball being kicked and the heavy breathing of the players who are runing
back and forth trying to score. The reason why I based my project out of a soccer field was because
Iâ€™m really passionate for the sport basically my life revolves around soccer and I've wanted to make a project that has to do with something that I'm actually really passionate about. The audience is able to experience this
by looking at the figure, the field and the ball and just imagining a really intense soccer game going on. Basically the influences for this piece were myself and some of the professional athletes that I look up to because I just love the sport and anything that has to do with soccer and the way the athletes show their passion for the sport makes me love it more and makes me look up to them even more.
