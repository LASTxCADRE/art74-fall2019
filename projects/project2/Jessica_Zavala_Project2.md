Soccer Complex

Medium :
Dimensions/duration : 3D Web VR
Attribution (burrow and tell) : Soccer  ball from poly, Soccer field from poly, Female figure from poly.

Basically my project smells like fresh cut grass and has the sound of loud audience on the sidelines 
yelling and cheering. The reason why I based my project out of a soccer field was because
Iâ€™m really passionate for the sport basically my life revolves around soccer.The audience is able to experience this
by looking at the figure, the field and the ball and just imagining a soccer game going on. Basically the influences for this
piece were myself because I just love the sport and anything that has to do with soccer.
