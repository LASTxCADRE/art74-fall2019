### Description

  This piece is supposed to draw the viewer's eye to the halftone statue first
and then eventually to other parts of the image. When animated the statue takes
many more forms while the background stays still. I always imagine the sound of
static when the static frames go by and also the beeps of a computer when the 
matrix rain falls.

  I thought changing the form was fun and I decided to use the different aspects
of media that most affect modern day America. The halftones of printed media, the
mosaic censorship, the transparency squares of photoshop, and the static of older
CRT TVs just to name a few. I want the viewer to think of these forms of the statue
individually and try to have them guess what it means to them. I'd like to think that
the works of Banksy is the influence of this piece as many of his pieces show scenes
that sort of splice in the real world with the illustrations that he creates.
