## Project Description (two paragraphs minimum)
    The concept behind my piece, "Impossibly Close", is focused on the common struggle between life and death. Specifically I wanted to focus on the moment when life begins to cross over into death and what that struggle of trying to stop that crossover from taking place. This piece is meant to capture the feeling of being so close to death and attempting to hold onto life, but ultimately failing because it's out of reach. I intend my piece to be a loose representation of how people close to death often have a difficult time accepting death and on impulse they try to keep a tight grasp on life and living. However, it's often that in the process, they become stuck in this "limbo" of denial and struggle until death takes over. 
    I intend for the piece to evoke the feeling of being stuck in this limbo when they experience the AR element of the artwork because the hands remain still in an open position while there are these elements connected to the string that are constantly moving. I believe this contrast in movement allows the audience to feel stuck by the inability of the waiting hands to take hold of these moving, living elements. Although my piece was largely made with the purpose of visual aesthetics in mind, a major influence present in my piece involves the Greek mythology of the Fates. This mythological influence is most present in the white strings that drape around the hands and hold the moving elements. The string is a nod to the String of Life that the Greek Fates control and cut, something I thought to be relevant  to add to my piece.
