## Project Description (two paragraphs minimum)
  The concept behind my piece, "Impossibly Close", is focused on the common struggle between life and death. Specifically I wanted to focus on the moment when life begins to cross over into death and what that struggle may feel like when trying to stall a death. This piece is meant to capture the feeling of being so close to death and attempting to grasp life, but ultimately failing because it's out of reach. I intend my piece to be a loose representation of how people close to death often have a difficult time trying to hold onto life, and in the process they become stuck in this "limbo" until death takes over. 
I intended for the audience to feel "stuck" when they experience the AR element of the artwork because the hands remain still in an open position while there are these elements connected to the string that are constantly moving, so that viewers feel stuck by the inability of the waiting hands to take the moving, living elements. 
One of the influences I had while making this piece was the idea of life in relation to a string, which I looked to the Greek mythology of the Fates.When this piece is presented, I intend for the artwork to spark a delicate, paranormal/mythical theme?
