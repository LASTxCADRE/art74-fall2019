### Description
Every project should address the following questions:
1. What does your project look/sound/smell/feel like?
My project look like there's invisable tension between the three jokers. It will sound quite and it will feels nervous.
2. What is the conceptual/personal/political motivation behind the project?
The personal motivation behind thie project is because the new joker movies is coming up and I have always been a fan of Joker, so I want to put three of the Jokers from different movies into on scene and it will be look like the Joker from the Sucide Squad is talking to the new Joker, but meanwhile the Joker from Dark Knight wants to murder them. 
3. What is the intended context? Where/how does the audience experience it?
The intended context will be the joker that is standing behind the wall (from the other Joker's perspective). the audience should experience it when they first see the collage.
4. What/who are your influences for this particular piece?
People who have/ intrested in Jokers or the movie that is coming up.
