### Description
I tried to get a feeling of the overall emotion that the Album "Hollywood is Bleeding" by Post Malone Conveys. 
The overall concept I am trying to convey is the overload of the world that we live in. The audience experiences the 
intended contect through the imagery that comes and goes. Post Malone and my partners style are my motivation for this 
piece.
