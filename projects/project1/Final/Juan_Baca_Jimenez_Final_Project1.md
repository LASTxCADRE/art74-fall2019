Description



   For my project, I was aiming for hues that symbolizes calmness, confidence, happiness, and positivity. The motivation behind this project was my personal interest in grass, because green is my favorite color. I find it interesting by the color, texture and how beautiful grass can appear. Also, grass can bring out the environment to be and feel so alive. This led me to input grass in the bottom of my collage. One of my favorite fruits are strawberries, so I wanted to included that into my collage. I intended to provide a 3-dimensional effect by creating a curvy pathway of strawberries. Each strawberry gets smaller further into space and it gives a 3D perpective. I used colors that go well with each other and making the collage vibrant. I included some blue irregular shapes that I created from Illustration and I thought they looked like birds and I thought they looked interesting. 
   
   I want the audience to feel lost in space. I purposely included a bright yellow rainbow shape liquid that has two blue doughnut shapes on both sides of the yellow liquid. I wanted that to be the starting point to catch one's eye leading the eye following the strawberries around the vibrant piece of the collage and diminishing into space. I would say I influenced myself on this paricular project. I didn't really look at specific types of artwork that influnced me to make something similar to it. I just went with the flow and tested what effects from Illustration and Photoshop that I liked and input them into my collage.
