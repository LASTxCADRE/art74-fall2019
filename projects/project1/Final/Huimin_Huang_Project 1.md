### Description
Every project should address the following questions:
1. What does your project look/sound/smell/feel like?   My project feels like positive, because there are sunshine on the top left, and every character here is optimistic. 
2. What is the conceptual/personal/political motivation behind the project?   I want to share the positive in life to everyone.
3. What is the intended context? Where/how does the audience experience it?   I made these because I know everyone would have difficulty sometimes, but don't give up just like these characters.
4. What/who are your influences for this particular piece?   When I had some negative, I would tell myself to be happy.
