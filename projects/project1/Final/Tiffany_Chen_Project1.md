My project is the city of San Francisco being covered by fog. It feels like a cold cloudy morning when the sun rises. I was
motivated to make this piece because I lived in San Francisco almost my whole life and I really miss the morning coldness when
the whole city is covered in fog. I made this to show that cold foggy weather is not the worst weather. Everybody loves the sun
and the heat but the fog is not that bad and it's actually really beautiful to look from afar when it's covering the Golden 
Gate Bridge. I would want people that grew up in hot areas to go visit San Francisco and experience the cold weather there.
