Description: <br>
	 This project is meant to be a representation of how beautiful the universe can be, and how we, as humans, are one of the very limited species that are permitted to inhabit it.  This piece is meant to be a reminder that there is more to the universe than just ourselves.  When looking at the image, I try to produce the senses of wonder and curiosity in people through the vibrant colors and the mesmerizing, moving graphics.  <br>
	I was inspired by my grandfather because he taught me many different things about the vastness of space.  I used to be obsessed with trying to find out as many things about space when I was younger, so this image makes me remember those times of wonder.
