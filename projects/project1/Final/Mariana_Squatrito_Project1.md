### Description
Calypso represents an inner turmoil. The faded, female silhouette stares off into space, yet she appears distant or disconnected, as if she were staring inward in thoughtful contemplation. Calypso is closed off yet vulnerable. The embedded flowers represent Calypso’s intent to show a beautiful, brave face; yet her gaze reveals a deeper, masked truth. Upon viewing, the audience is prompted to experience an empathetic reaction to the silhouette’s sad, contemplative, wistful feelings. 

The title suggests a connection to the Greek mythological princess, Calypso, who lives in constant isolation on a hidden island. Periodically, as punishment, Calypso is sent warriors, who are stranded on the island until, inevitably, she falls in love with them. Tragically, when her feelings become undeniable, the warriors are sent a raft and permitted to leave and return to their cause. Calypso is again left alone to contemplate her constant struggle with love and loss. Calypso’s constant inner struggle is symbolic of a hidden perpetual struggle that everyone faces.
