Description: 
This project is a picture of a woman holding a lantern & when it is animated, the lantern lights fade out. I chose this action
because I wanted it to have an aesthetic type of vibe to it.
<p>
Every project should address the following questions:
<p>
What does your project look/sound/smell/feel like?
My project feels relaxed and has a modern type of feel to it while also being simple. 
<p>
What is the conceptual/personal/political motivation behind the project?
My motivation was to bring my love for photography to something new and blend the two together.
<p>
What is the intended context? Where/how does the audience experience it?
Everyone has different things that could stress them out in life, when looking at this gif the audience should feel
somewhat calm and aesthetically pleased when looking at the lantern.
<p>
What/who are your influences for this particular piece?
Brandon Woelfel is my main influence for this piece because of how he captures his photographs in such a modern aesthetic sort
of way.
