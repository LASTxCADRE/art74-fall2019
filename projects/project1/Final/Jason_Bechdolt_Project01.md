### Description
1. My project has a strong contrast between lights and the darks and overall has some intense elements like the super bright shining and the shattering of the crystal
2. I am a huge fan of hollow knight, and the character Myla and the asthetic of the place you find her came to mind and i thought it would be cool to portray a possible way in which the radiance instilled her existance into Myla's mind.
3. (Spoiler Alert:read no further if you wish to play Hollow Knight) The being known as The Radiance exerts her influence simply through the image and knowledge of her existence, thats all she needs to be able to invade their dreams and turn them into infected husks of who they used to be, remotely controlled by the Radiance. The caves that this scene takes place in are full of crystals that are linked to the radiance in some unknown way, and I thought it would be a cool visual to have the reflected image of the radiance in a crystal be the way that Myla was infected
4. The game Hollow Knight by Team Cherry influenced my project
