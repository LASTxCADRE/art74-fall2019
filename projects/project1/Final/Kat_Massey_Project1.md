Every project should address the following questions:

What does your project look/sound/smell/feel like?
  My project looks as though you on an old computer screen interacting with the grainy images. In my mind, it would constantly be making 'ping ping'
  noises, almost like the sounds your phone makes when you get a notification... almost annoying in a way...
  It smells like plastic,and dust.
  And it feels like the past.


What is the conceptual/personal/political motivation behind the project?
  My personal motivation behind this project is from memories of me playing old CD ROM games on my Windows PC computer. I remeber playing computer games
  alot from my childhood and I also had a deep love for all things Barbie so I wanted to reconnect in a way with those same images, 
  feelings, memories and overall aesthetic.
  I miss the things that I took joy in from my childhood. In my lifetime, technology has advanced so much, 
  it's fun to remember fat computers and tvs, and grainy images, and the sound of a windows computer booting up...
  


What is the intended context? Where/how does the audience experience it?
  The intended context is to bring the audience into an environment of images from my past that they can experience and hopefully see 
  things from my perspective.
  Everyone's childhood was different and everyone has different favorites from their childhood and I just want them to re-explore those
  maybe forgotten memories of things that were so simple but brought them so much joy in the moment.
  

What/who are your influences for this particular piece?
  My influences for this piece are: 90's and early 20's technology, girly girl, play, fun, vaporwave, "Barbie Storymaker Game"
  Windows PC, my childhood, and simpler times.
