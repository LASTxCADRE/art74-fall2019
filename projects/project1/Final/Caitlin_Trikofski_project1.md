### Description
Every project should address the following questions:
1. What does your project look/sound/smell/feel like? I think my project feels a bit sad, more on the lonely side. I don't think you would be able to hear or smell and thing but it would look very colorful.
2. What is the conceptual/personal/political motivation behind the project? I wanted to show a message about someone with social anxiety; you can still feel alone even when there's people all around you.
3. What is the intended context? Where/how does the audience experience it? The audience should be able to observe the little girl sitting alone in what feels like a crowded space of other items or entities.
4. What/who are your influences for this particular piece? I have a friend living in New York who struggles with this issue, he was a big inspiration for this piece.
