1. What does your project look/sound/smell/feel like?
My project feels chaotic and almost dream like. There’s a feeling of being in a different mindscape and the image overall is meant to feel like the viewer is looking into a dream land.
2. What is the conceptual/personal/political motivation behind the project?
This project had a personal motivation since I spend a lot of my time daydreaming and with my head in the clouds. I wanted to convey that same feeling of being lost in a dream with this project.
3. What is the intended context? Where/how does the audience experience it?
The intended context was to create an image where the audience feels like they’re in a dream as well or something close to that.
4. What/who are your influences for this particular piece?
I would say that I am the influence. I added things that I would see in a dream or that would represent some part of my dream landscape.
