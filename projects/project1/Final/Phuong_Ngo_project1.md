### Description
My project has some tropical palm trees with neon signs and shapes that somehow give it a retro feeling. Among the seasons of the year, I'm in love with summer the most, because it always gives me the opportunity to travel around, to experience and meet new people. I personally made this in my first project to remind myself of the places I have gone to, and how much I enjoy this time of the year. As can be seen in the image, there are some palm trees that represent the beach and some blinking neon signs that can often be seen at night parties. I especially add the glitch effect to indicate the hype and thrilling feeling one may have. Overall, the whole thing indicate my thought of having a wonderful time in a summer beach party.
