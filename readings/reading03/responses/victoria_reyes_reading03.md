  To begin to understand the concept, we should start with the format-agnostic approach. The format starts with the “Who” labeled as the x-axis, and the “What” labeled as the y-axis. 
  The y-axis is for the audience, targeted and broad. The x-axis is for content, brand-centric and editorial.
From here is where we determine how to best tell our “story”. There are several examples throughout the Chapter on what is best. Based on current affairs, I would use vaping as an example. 
The makers of the vape targets their audience using the brand-centric format. Their audience is definitely targeted towards teens and young adults. 
On the other spectrum, you can see the more recent stories, discussing the dangers, being targeted to a broad audience with editorial content. 
You can use visuals in both. However, the story targeting the broader audience should be more editorial-based.
