Reading number three was about communication through graphics to your audience. When you are creating a visual image for an audience it is important to ask yourself two questions: who is the audience, and what are you communicating to them? For the first question, there are two types of audiences, targetted and broad. For a targetted audience you information is more detailed and specific to the reader. For example if your audience is targetted to athletic men you can give specific health benefits for the athletic male instead of including health benefits for an average female. When you are communicating to a broad audence you must treat every member of the entire audience equally. Most information you use will be more broad and able to connect with many diverse members of the audience.

In this article, I learned what editorial content is compared to leadership content. Editorial content is material that is used to tell a story, like a company's blog. Editorial content is not targetted to a specific audience. Leadership content is used to engage the reader and give them something of value. For example, this could be a company member speaking on topics and analysis of the companies accomplishments. Leadership content is used to reach as large an audience as possible. One important thing I learned from this article was that you must identify your objectives before you decide on your method of communication. I also learned that you don't always have to reach a broad audience, sometimes a target audience is more beneficial for your project.
