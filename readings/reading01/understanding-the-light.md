[Reading 01]

In the reading from the European Lighting School "Understanding the Light" there's several topics discussed. The most interesting and remarkable are that all things are actually only black and white and simple reflect light to make a color. In the reading there's also two seperate color wheels. One of which contains the primary colors Red, Blue, and Green although in my earlier school years I was led to believe yellow is a primary color but we learn in fact that red and green make yellow. Regardless there are secondary colors used as well like red + blue which create magenta and blue + green which creatr cyan. The main focus of this wheel creates white within the center of all the colors. In another wheel the secondary colors create the primary colors meaning yellow, cyan, and magenta are secondary and red, green, and blue being primary. The main focus of this color wheel is black. You then find out all colors mixed together create black which is the opposite of white. 

Other noticeable things are color is the attribute of visual perception consisting of any combination of chromatic and achromatic components. The first few chapters also heavily go into light whereas the ones toward the end go into color and the coloring wheels. Some facts about light that are mentioned are that what changes the color of objects is "a result of reflection of light in combination with the composition of the surface" and that therefore everything can be changed based off the different lighting illuminating said object. Light defined in the book is "an electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum" and that visible light is measured in incriments of nanometers usually ranging from 380-740.
