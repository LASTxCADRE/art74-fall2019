"Understanding the Light" was a very indepth look on how light is percieved by our eyes and the wave legnths that we can see. Viable light's wave is at the range of 380-740 nanometers which surprises me that we can only see a specific part of the color spectrum. Much of this light is emit from light sources or reflected off an object. Many of these wavelenghts can be abosrbed or reflected in which that color that is reflected is what we see. As Bill Nye stated "We can only see the world by the way color is reflected" is also facinating to me.
Some light can also absorb more in certain colors or reflect and transmit different colors which is why it can be important for people to study and use certain colors for certain objects or even buildings to reflect light and heat. Color filters can also be useful to in blocking out certain colors when trying to detract light as well. It also was cool how the dancer stated that her dicetion of light not only sets the mood and gives lighting but also presents color and adds more color which were there naturally.
