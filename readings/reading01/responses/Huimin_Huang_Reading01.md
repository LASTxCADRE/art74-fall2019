When I linked into this website, the first thing that captured my mind is "Color is the place where our brain and universe 
meet". Light makes our lives being meaningful. The primary color is RGB which is Red, Green and Blue. I thought yellow is 
primary color before, but I know that is a secondary color now. We can't see the light itself, but its reflection from the 
obstacles, and it can reflected to many directions.

When I was young, I always thought white light means no light. But actually it's not, white light means the light has no 
color. Also, white light can become rainbow light. Different temperature and be different light.
