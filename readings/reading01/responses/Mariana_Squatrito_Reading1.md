Understanding the Light defines the properties of “visible light” and how it interacts with our environment.The concept of light has always been a difficult idea for me to wrap my head around, therefore, I found this reading fascinating and helpful in defining how light interacts with our surrounding environment. 

White light is composed of different wavelengths of colored light. Light can either pass through, be absorbed, or it can be reflected by an object. Perhaps the most fascinating part of light is the attributes of the colors. The three attributes of color are Hue, Saturation, and Brightness. Hue is defined as the designation of a basic color, such as red or purple, and it corresponds to wavelength. I found it interesting that because the spectrum of color is infinite, the describing hues are infinite as well. Saturation defines the fullness of a color. For instance, a dull grey-blue has a low saturation vs. a bright cobalt blue has a high saturation. The brightness is determined by how much the surface emits light. 

The most informative portion of this reading was the section on color mixing. I have often heard the term RGB but did not realize that it was a type of additive color mixing. I was fascinated to learn that when the three colors (red, green, and blue) overlap, they create white light. In contrast to additive mixing, the subtractive color model starts with while light and gradually removes colors. Subtractive color mixing is used to create more color variety out of a limited dye, ink, or pigment selection.
