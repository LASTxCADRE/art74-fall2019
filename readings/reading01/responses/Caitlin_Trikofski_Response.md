Caitlin Trikofski Reading Response:
When reading the article on RGB colors, I learned many new things as well as shown many examples. Something that I found interesting was how the light reacted with each other when overlaid. They looked exactly how their pallet was laid out to look like, yet you could use unique shapes to turn it into a piece of art. I was confused at first on why the article was stating that green was a primary color in terms of RGB light, I still am confused. Yet, I’m also amazed how putting together these two or three dark colors; mixed together to make lighter ones. As well as mixing the lighter colors made such weird darker colors, colors you wouldn’t expect them to make.
After reading this article, I’m curious as to how we will be using this style of light and shadow in class. I think the projects will look interesting. I’m also curious about what other affects you’ll be able to create or discover while working with this information. I would like to learn how they were able to make the photos they made and if we have the time and materials to make our own photos as well.
