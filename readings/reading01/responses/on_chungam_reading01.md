The idea of light is simple but the mechanics of it are more than just simple. In the reading it says light only allows us to see the surroundings areas and our eyes see reflections of the light from objects. We don’t see light because light is invisible. It is an electromagnetic radiation like x-rays. We can describe it by its wavelength or by its frequency. The light that we can see has wavelengths in the range between 380 and 740 nanometers. I did not know that some light wavelengths are slower than others such as violet and blue light. White light is also the one that generally has no specific color but rather has a mix of all kinds of colors as shown by Isaac Newton’s prism experiment. 

I also think it’s interesting how white objects can reflect all wavelengths of light but black ones don’t reflect any. Also how colored objects will absorb other colored wavelengths but reflects their color of the spectrum. I know a bit about RGB colors since that’s used to display colors on our computers. Whereas CMYK is more for working on projects not meant to be seen through a screen. Light is a lot more complicated than just what we see. There are many technicalities to it that I learned from this reading.
