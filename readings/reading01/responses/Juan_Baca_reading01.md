Light has been discovered by physicists describing light as a wave or a particle. Light that is visible is when it is visible to the human eye and is processed by the sight. Visible light defined by having wavelengths in the range between 380 and 740 nanometers (nm). The longer wavelengths are infared and the shorter wavelengths are ultraviolet. The speed of light is constant according to the Einstein's theory.
The light is reflected from different obstacles. Light that penetrates through such an object without being dispersed to several directions then that is called transparent. Refraction is when light altering of direction passing from one environment to another. White light is the light that has significant color and white light contains a mixture of colored light. Different wavelenghts in the spectrum are perceived as representing different hues with the range from purple-blue which are the short wavelengths to red which are the long wavelengths.

Color temperature is the temperature of an ideal black-body radiator that radiates light from a light source. Color temperature is important when wanting to match different kinds of light sources. Hue is a designation for basic colors of the spectrum like blue or green. Stauration or chroma is the purity of a color. High saturation is rich and full and low saturation is dull and greyish looking. Brightness is the value of lightness and intensity. The tint, shade, and tone is a way to describe colors, based on hue, saturation and brightness.
