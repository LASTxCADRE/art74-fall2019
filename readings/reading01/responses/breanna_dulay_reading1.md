Beginning the reading, I immediately noticed how much I didn't actually understand about light, how we perceive it, how it changes our percepetions of objects, and how colors in light mix. I approached the reading with basic knowledge of light from previous science classes in mind.However, my preconceptions about light and color caught me offguard once I completely read through the lesson, largely because I had the expectation that the way colors in light mix is the same as how paint mixes on a palette. Despite the two being similar through the basic fundamentals of color, there is so much more complexity to light and how types of light mix. I was most interested in how we can change the way we perceive light, such as how blocking out colors from white light allow a different color to be seen. I also found it particularly useful how the lesson explained in detail how we perceive light and how light allows to perceive the objects around us in different ways. 

Although I found the entire lesson to be both useful and relevant, the section on color mixing was one of the most interesting parts
of the lesson because I liked being able to compare traditional fundamentals of color mixing with such a nonconventional medium such as 
light. Along with the introduction test, the reading allowed me to see what I actually know versus what I thought I knew. Though I'm
already familiar with the rules of color and color mixing,there is so much more that I had been unaware of concerning the science and 
the art behind light. I believe a lot of my misconceptions have to do with the fact that I've stayed in this comfort zone where I haven't 
ventured past colors on a palette or colors past the screen. I haven't tried to really push past what I already know about color which
makes this read all the more interesting to me. Now that I'm aware of how to more thoroughly understand light, I'm interested in how light
can applied to digital media and how it can be used as a medium for art or more unconventional purposes. With my newfound knowledge, 
I'm branching out my interests further towards luminism and light art.
