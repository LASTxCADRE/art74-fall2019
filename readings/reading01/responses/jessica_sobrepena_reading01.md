The concept of Section five reading one was about two color models which were Additive color mixing and Subtractive color mixing.
The color groups these models mix with are broken down first into three categories; primary, secondary, and tertiary colors.
Primary colors consist of Red, Blue, and Yellow. Secondary colors are made by mixing the combinations of the primary colors:
Red and Blue, Yellow and Red, and Blue and Yellow. The last color group which is the tertiary color group is made from mixing secondary and
primary colors. Additive color mixing was explained as RGB mixing to reproduce other colors in the spectrum where three light beams have to be superimposed.
While working with stage lighting, additive mixing comes up very often. Though the stage lights are used in RGB which help the light designer a lot,
it is said that some colors end up not turning out how they are supposed to or they don't show at all. With Subtractive mixing,
a subtractive color model explains the mixing of a limited set of dyes, inks, & paint pigments. Each have a partial or complete absorption
to some wavelengths of light. The main difference between the two models is that additive starts out with no light or darkness while adding color
while subtractive starts off with light.
