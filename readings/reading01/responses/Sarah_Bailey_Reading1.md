  The reading assignment "Understanding the light" mostly focuses on the RGB color spectrum and other subjects regarding the spectrum of visual light. Light can be both a wave and a particle, though in the lesson is treated as only a wave. Visual light is a wave between 380 and 740 nanometers in wavelength. What we see as light isnt the wave itself, but rather its reflection bouncing back into our eyes from obstacles. A reflected light generally stays in the same plane and angle it was before.
    White light is the mixture of all types of colored light, with each wavelength in the spectrum being seen as red, orange, yellow green, blue, etc. The color of white light, or when a white light appears more yellow or blue, is called color tempurature, and is referred to as warmer or colder. The hotter the tempurature of the light, the colder its color tempurature is.
    Colored lights are lights with a specific wavelength. Some transparent objects absorb certain colors to make others more prevelant. The three attributes of colored light is hue, saturation, and brightness. Additive color mixing adds colors together to make white or other colors, while subtractive makes black.
