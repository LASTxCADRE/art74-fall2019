**The reading talks about the basic concept of the lights. I learned the RGB color model is an additive color model that red, green,and blue can be add together to create different colors. CMY color model in the other hand is a subtractive model that include cyan, magenta, yellow pigments that will subtracted from each others to create other colors. By looking at the images that were providing in the reading, in my own understanding, RGB color model is usually showing white light in the center when you mix red, blue, and green. On the other hand, CMY color has a black color base. There is one thing that surprise me on the reading, I didn't know violet and blue lights is slower than red and yellow light. I know that blue and violet tend to be a cold color and yellow and red tend to be warm color. 
**Then I learned about light. I already knew that light can be reflect through different obstacles, mostly obstacles that are transparents and can be reflect. But I didn't know that there are two reflection. One is call specular and other is call diffuse. Specular reflection is flat and bright and it makes the light's rays refelcted in the same direction and diffuse reflections makes the rays reflected in the same angle. I also learned the smaller the number it is, the mostly it will be warm color. For example, 1700K is match flame and 7000k is a overcast daylight. It is like a comparasion of sunset and sunrise.Lastly, I learned light can be affected by hue, saturation, and value. In my own understanding, hue is the lightest and value will be de darkest, which is close to black, but it will still kepp its color.
