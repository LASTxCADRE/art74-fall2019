Unnderstanding the light was about how visible light is usually defined as haing wavelengths in the range of 380 and 740 nanometers.Also it says that infrared and ultraviolet are also called light although they are not detectable with human sight. Light can be reflected or it can be absorved. It surpriced me that altering of direction of the light when passing from one enviroment to another is called refraction and it's scientifically described as Snell's law. Something I did not know was that when a beam of light is dispersed, that it is called diffuse reflection. It;s so amazinng how white light contains a mixture of all kinds of colored light.
