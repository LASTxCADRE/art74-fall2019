  Everything that we can observe releases light or reflects it towards us, light allows us to see colors and it can be
described either as a wavelength or a particle. The only thing that we are able to see is the reflections from our 
surroundings but not light itself. If little to non of the light is being reflected from an object towards your eyes then the 
object will appear to look dark, but if the object reflects more light then it will appear brighter. White light has a mixture 
of a lot of colored light. The colors can go from the color purple, which is a cool color and has shorter wavelenghts, to the 
color red, which is a warm color and has longer wavelengths. White light is the mixture of all the spectral colors found inside
the white light.
  Color correction filters can block unwanted wavelenghts. A color light is actually white light but without some wavelengths.
Those unwanted wavelengths are being blocked by filters that only allow to emit one certain color and absorbed the rest. All 
lamps render colors differently, some render colors almost equally which emit a whiter light, but other lamps have a stronger
color that is dominant, giving the light a certain color that is being emitted. The way an object gets its color is by 
reflecting back a certain color wavelength and absorbing the rest of the wavelengths, and then releasing the absorbed 
wavelengths as heat. White reflects all the white light while black absorbs everything. Three different physical properties 
of light are hue,saturation, and brightness. In lighting you can do addictive color mixing to get secondary colors or 
subtractive color mixing to get your primary colors. Everything around us is black and white but the way light is being 
reflected it gives its color.
