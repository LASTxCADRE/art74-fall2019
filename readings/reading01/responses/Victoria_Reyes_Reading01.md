Section 5, color models, went into depth on how to create a broad range of colors. The first part of color models talked about how specific you should be when searching for different colors and how different kinds of lights can affect the color you would like to get. The second section went on to talk about the basic primary colors; red, blue and green which is also known as RGB. And by understanding; primary, secondary, and terciary colors to come up with more color mixtures. 

A lot of the information in the color models are informative because it is important for us to understand how to differentiate what types of colors and lighting will be the best for certain projects. What I found the most interesting is the mixing in stage lighting. Before I read this I didn't know much of the odds of using RGB fixtures. Like how some colors won't be creator simply just don't look good, or how it can lower intensities.
