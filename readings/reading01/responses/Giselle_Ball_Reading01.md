Section five of reading number one focused on the color models and mixing. Color mixing is a way of creating a range of colors. It is important for us to understand what color mixing is because it affects how colored lights will blend on a performance stage. The system focused on emitting light is called RGB mixing. The three-light beams superimposed red green and blue forms a color. The primary colors (red, green and blue) together compose the color white. The secondary colors are created by evenly mixing two primary colors. Tertiary colors are created by mixing primary and secondary colors. 

The subtractive model the mixing of a limited set of dyes or pigments to create a wider range of colors. The more pigments you mix the more light will be absorbed. Subtractive models begin with light colors and we subtract colors from that. In the subtractive model, secondary colors are the primary colors in the additive model. They are created when the primary is subtracted from each other. Tertiary colors are created by mixing primary colors and secondary colors. The principals of subtractive mixing are used when more filers are used in conjunction.
