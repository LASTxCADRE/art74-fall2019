Section 5 of the reading focused on mainly the different colors of light and the different colors of pigments and the way that they interact. The colors of light do not mix in the way that one would expect, with the primary colors being blue green and red, these combining in different ways to form yellow magenta and cyan, which are secondary colors of the light wheel, but are Primary colors of the pigment wheel, with blue green and red being secondary on that pigment wheel. Wehn all 3 primary light colors are combined the color white is achieved where the primary pigment colors will yield black. Stage Lighting will mostly make use of RGB LED's that are capable of efficiently displaying a range of colored light.I actually learned this in Physics last year so this is mostly review with the addition of some extra details
The other two paragraphs mentioned stuff outside of section 5 so I'll do a basic run down. Specular reflection reflects a beam of light off its surface in the same direction maintaining the shape of that light, while diffuse reflection sends the light evenly in all directions. Light can have a temperature, And I have made great use of the temperature function in microsoft word to achieve the desired feel to an image that I wanted. White reflects light, Black absorbs light. Luminous flux is perceived power of a light source, luminous intensity is the light power emitted per unit solid angle, measured in candela.
