“Understanding the light” is a very fascinating lesson to me. It starts with very complicated concept of different kinds of wave. Later on, the lesson gives new knowledge about light, how it works, and the colors that we usually see. We don’t actually see white light so we assume that it has no color, but indeed it’s a mixture of all kinds of colored light. Giving the rainbow as an example make me feel easier to understand, that when the colors overlap it create the white light. It’s really interesting to learn that everything doesn’t really have a color. In fact, the chemicals of one object absorb the colors from white light, and the color that it does not absorb will reflect to our eyes and we see it as that color. 
I also learn the concepts of 2 different physical properties of light: hue, saturation, brightness; and the systems of colors models, which based on mixing colors from the basic hues. The lesson also shows me the concept of primary, secondary and tertiary colors. Before this, I do know a little about primary and secondary colors, but only after reading the chapter did I learn more about how it actually works by mixing the main colors. In addition to that, interestingly, subtractive a color from another source of light works the same way around. Throughout the lesson, the real-life images of overlapping the lights also caught my eyes of how amazing they actually look like when putting light and colors on study.
