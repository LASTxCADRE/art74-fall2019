In the reading "Web Work: History of Internet Art" I learned that in the beginning the internet was not very popular and it 
wasn't being taken very seriously by people, but internet enthusiastics and net artists made it interesting by making the 
internet more accesible and easier to use for someone to express themselves and being able to join a community for support
and exchanging ideas. 

I think that it was interesting that with the net art and other art projects that allowed to interact with people helped 
gain more views and increased the exposure of the internet to those who interacted with the art stunt; for example, the 
"Kings Cross Phone-In" project by Heath Bunting, it allowed other people from around the world to speak to British citizens 
through phone booths. This project would peak the citizens curiosity of how it was done, what was the cause of all the phone
booths to ring throughout the day.
