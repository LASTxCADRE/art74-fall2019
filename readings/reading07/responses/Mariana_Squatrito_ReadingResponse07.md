Rachel Greene’s Web Work highlights the development of net.art in the early and late 90’s. Greene brings to light that Net art opened a new window for artists, to work “independently of any bureaucracy or art-work institution.” Net.art created new opportunities for artists’ collaborate and experiment with other artists all over the world. Artists, such as the creators behind Jodi.org, wanted to either expose code or work with “glitched” code. Many of the sites are interactive in an effort to get viewers to understand and work with the basic elements of their computer. 

Net.artists often have a political agenda. Their choice of medium opens up access to express their thoughts internationally. Anna de Haan is one such artists with a particular interest in “cyberfeminism.” However, her works were not met with much enthusiasm. On the other hand, Russian artist Olia Lialina, worked her way up as an accomplished female net.artist due to her elegant designs. Lialina’s piece, My Boyfriend Came Back from the War, is a strong example of her aesthetically pleasing “frame” programming designs. 

The article is interesting to read from a contemporary point of view because the almost rudimentary net.art has now exploded in to many different categories of technological art: such as Web Ar and VR, website design, glitch artists etc…. In a way, contemporary culture can not be separated from web art and technology. It is fascinating to get a sense of how net.art developed.
