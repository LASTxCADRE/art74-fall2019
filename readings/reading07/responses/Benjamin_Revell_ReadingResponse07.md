Net.art was a movement in the 20th century that employed the use of early HTML
and themes within the computer's UI in order to create an aesthetic that is 
unique to the era. Like most art movements, the Net.art movement was highly 
influenced by the current political ideologies. Things like racism, sexism, and
self image were some of the few issues that many webpage art pieces covered. 
The Net.art movement was in a particularly special era of the internet. At the time,
huge companies haven't integrated their way into the new space of advertising,
so many of the websites that existed at the time were either personal webpages
or advertisements for new technology. 

I think that the Net.art movement was a brilliant thing. Like the decades before the Net.art
movement was started, people have used elements within the media to express themselves. 
I think something like the Net.art movement might have a bit more difficulty getting off
the ground if it were started in today's internet climate. Things like social media and 
mass advertising would draw attention away from these personal homepages and art exhibits.
Seeing these webpages is like a glimpse into the past and it's very interesting.
