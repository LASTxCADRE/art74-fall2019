In this reading, I found out what Net Art is. It happened when there was a glitch that occurred when the person opened an
email. When people find out about this term "Net-Art", it became a popular thing and it had spread around quite a lot. Net
art can be referred to graphics, emails, text and images, etc. It's a way of artist comunication and sharing their interests. 

I thought this reading was really interesting. I never thought net art started off as a glitch. I never though glitch was a
type of art in the first place. The pictures on the reading was also really cool even though it looks old. I would like to
try net art if I am able to do it even though it looks and sounds really hard to do.
