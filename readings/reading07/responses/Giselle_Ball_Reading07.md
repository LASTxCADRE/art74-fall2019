This article really surprised me. I didn’t know how prominent internet art was during the begging stages of the internet. I assumed in the early days of the internet the only websites where those form large companies. I thought the art world’s impact on the internet was a more recent idea. I think it’s very cool how artists got into coding early and created these artistic websites or domains. Today, most artists simply post their artwork on the internet through a boring webpage. I think these net arts from the past are way more impactful than simply posting a picture online. I’m surprised there isn’t as much net art now since coding has become more universal and well known.

I looked up some of the websites in the article and they are very interesting. For example,  jodi.org is a black screen filled with random pictures of simple things like sketches and a thumb. Every time you search up the website you seem to get a different page to look at. The article talked about how it easily shows yo the code behind it but the code it usually overwhelming to even experienced coders. I find this very interesting because this website seems like it is trying to play a game or taunt us.
