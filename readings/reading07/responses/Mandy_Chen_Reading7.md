When I was reading this article, I was impressed by the development of the net art. I actually like the style of the web that was created at the beginning. People are still using those web today to create a retro design. I am also appricate for the development of the net, that gives us an opportunity to have more interaction and have more ways to design the things we want. The internet also allows us to look at other artists' work and provide us a large community to talk about our art with all around the world.

I love the net that has the story about a girl's boyfriend came back from war, I think she is very creative to create a website that allows people to interact with the website and also get to know about her feeling. She provides lots of different options and images to let us choose from and I hope there are more website that are like this!
