	Rachel Greene's article on the history of internet art was an intriguing read for me and further fed my interest in the concentration of digital media. I appreciated the screenshots of all the different works as well as the background included for some of them for further insight. One of the aspects of the article that stood out to me while I was reading was the simplicity of the tools used, yet the work still holds that same impact today. This is not to say that art created using modern day advanced software like 3DS Max or Photoshop does not hold the same impact, yet, the simplicity of the tools used combined with the effect of the concept creates a completely different type of experience. 
		It was interesting that the reading allowed me to see the humble beginnings of internet art, and even more so to compare it to modern day internet art. I found myself thinking about the different aspects and energies of beginning internet art and how we could channel that same energy or principle in creating our own internet works. At the end of this reading, the possibilities of web art have expanded even more, as well as my own excitement for experimentation in this media.
