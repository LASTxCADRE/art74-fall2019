Reading 07:

    While reading Web Work by Rachel Greene, the first thing I noticed about the pages are the pictures. I really like how she has made art out of file images on old computers. I also like  how the tags or titles under the images just add to its aesthetic. I remember using an old computer like this when I was younger, my dad would let me play those disk games you had to put in the actual computer. I also remember the little pixel file images of these games and thought it all looked nice even though it got messy.
    
    I also liked reading about the history of the internet, what art was back then, what people thought of the internet and the terms/ lingo they used to use. The one that most caught my eye was how they used to call Catfishing “cyber-rape” where a guy first lied about his gender in an intimate chat room. I thought that was a really funny thing about the internet, you give people something new and they already find a way to do things like what that man did. What also caught my eye was how they were calling Jodi.org a media cult and it’s ironic and interesting to see that the two creators met and discussed the creation of the site in general met in San Jose, CA.
