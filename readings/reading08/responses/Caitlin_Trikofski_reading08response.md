Reading 08:

    While reading the article on software art and coding, I didn’t really get where the author was coming from. I get that his point is that the art isn’t in the code, it’s in what that code eventually creates. I still don’t get what he’s trying to prove, because in the following sentences he claims that the bare code is actual art. I don’t get who he’s trying to prove wrong or right. The way I see it, code is just text and it doesn’t really look like or represent art. If that code eventually creates something unique on your screen then it’s art.

Another thing about the article that I didn’t really understand was the definitions he included, it looked like he used 2 different definitions for each. However, the definitions were almost identical, and if not then they were identical, but I also didn’t understand the point in him comparing them. All in all, I found this article pretty confusing and I couldn’t clearly see what the author was getting at.
