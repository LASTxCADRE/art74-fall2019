At the museum, there were many artworks that had called out to me, but one in particular stuck out to me.  This artpiece is called **Agamemnomics** created by Pae White.  When I look at it, it brings me back my childhood, while also appealing my liking of toys.  When I first saw it, I thought of how such an artwork can bring out both innocence and the sense of war in me.  I feel like the fact that there are many of the same toy duplicated, it feels as if it is an army getting ready to attack.  When looking through each unique piece, one in particular caught my eye; it was a golden flower that a blue petal and a gold base.  I like how a toy can bring out different levels of innocence; the toy itself can bring out child-like innocence, while the flower can bring out matured innocence.  It has a good combonation of many different emotions, and I just feel as though it was produced really well.
