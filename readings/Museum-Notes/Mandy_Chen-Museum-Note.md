I like the work of Rina Banerijee, she made all of her works mostly with sand, plastic, and fake flowers and bones. I like one of the pieces that has a rhinoceros in the center of the piece and there are bones supporting the rhinoceros. The other pieces I like is from Rory Padeken. There is one piece that He uses lots of hexagons conncect to each other and its shadow creastes another reflection on the wall and creates another image. That's what I like about it.
