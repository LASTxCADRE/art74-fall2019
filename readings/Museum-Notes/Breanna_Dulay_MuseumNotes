One of the artworks that stood out the most to me was "Poetic Titles" on the lower level of SJMA. "Poetic Titles" is an interactive artwork 
that was composed of two different works. One work involved magnetic words on a wall that people could piece together to form a poetic title. The other work has a similar concept, but was audio based and involved different languages for every poetic title. I loved this artwork because it allows for interactivity from a wide range of people, artists, children, young and old people. I especially like the idea of being able to leave our poetic print somewhere, albeit temporarily, an especially powerful aspect of the artwork.
