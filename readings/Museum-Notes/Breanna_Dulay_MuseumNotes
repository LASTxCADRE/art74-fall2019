One of the artworks that stood out the most to me was "Poetic Titles" on the lower level of SJMA. I loved this artwork because it allows 
for interactivity from a wide range of people, artists, children, young and old people. I especially like the idea of being able to leave our poetic print somewhere, albeit temporarily, an especially powerful aspect of the artwork.
