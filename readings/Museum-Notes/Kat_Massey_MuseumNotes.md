      Whistleblower, 2019
      
      ink, cable, electroplated steel
       
      Pae White
      
      
      I really took interest in this piece and was drawn to it immediately.
      Once I saw it, I walked over to it with a faster pace and viewed much longer than I did with any of the other art installations at
      the museum. 
      I really liked how Pae used the space and chose to have this piece hanging from long and separated cords of different lengths.
      I also really enjoyed how they thought that the lighting and the part of the room was very important for this piece. The sun shone through
      the window and created multiple overlayed shadows onto the walls that the piece was infront of. And since it was in a corner, and above, it made sense
      that the artist put it there possibly because they knew it would create shadow. It's also cool because since the piece is also part shadow,
      you take into the fact that its always changing as the sun moves so time has a huge aspect in this piece too.
       And also wind could play into affect too, although since it is indoors theres not going to be much 'movement' but if you could blow on it or
       there was shifting from people walking upstairs, that also plays into it.
       
       And another reason I quite enjoyed this piece was the different type of patterns and colors of the hexagonal metal plates.
       This art installation piece reminded me of the window displays at a store I like called Anthropologie.
