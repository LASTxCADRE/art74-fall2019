My favorite piece in the museum was the big red castle called "Take me, take me, take me to the Palace of love". It's on the 
secong floor and it's also the biggest piece there. I really got my attention because of the size of it. It is made up of many
materials like plastic, steel, copper, floral picks, foam balls, etc. The palace resembles the Indian's Taj Mahal where it was 
built in the seventeenth century by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan for his beloved wife. I really like how it looked and that it's 
about love.
