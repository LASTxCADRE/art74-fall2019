One of the art piece that I found interesting was the box that would say the words from the cards. It was pretty interesting because I had never seen something like that before and it really amazed me. I also thought that the art made from recycling was interesting because it really sends a message and it shows what the world is now. Most of the art in the museum was made out of recycling which is crazy because it shows how much trash there is that we can even make art from it.
