I liked how the pieces in the museum all followed some cultural aesthetic or imitation of a religion or group of people. I also like how the pieces would be abstract yet replicate a standard object. Such as the large flower sculptures, made from different materials, yet it also looked like a monster with large teeth, making it come off as abstract and abnormal. Another example for this would be the many human-like figures, both painted and sculpted, were very abstract, inside and outside of itself and its surroundings. I also thought the downstairs exhibitions interesting, especially the walk in room that was pitch black and had quick moving letters flying across the wall, there was a very interesting message in that piece. 

A piece that stood out to me the most was one titled/ described as “Lentil flour, chickpeas mixed fermented fried-balls presented in the leaf of bananas could cure the hunger of labouring man”; a piece that looked like bananas and other fruits hanging in a tropical forrest. This piece was among 3 others that were similar to it, but this one spoke to me the most. I found its entire visual aesthetic very appealing because it reminded me of other objects I've taken inspiration from so many times before. The piece made me feel oddly at home and safe, like I was in a relaxing area from a dream.
