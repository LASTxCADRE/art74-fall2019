Last thursday I had the opportunity to visit the SJ Museum of Art. It had been awhile since I had visited the museum but when
I observed the gallery exhibits I was blown away by all the amazing art that was featured there. I really enjoyed the different 
types of artwork as well as the various display choices made. Overall it was a great experience.

One piece that really stood out to me was a piece by Rina Banerjee. It was called Audio Title Builder and the way it worked was
with these card pieces that had words on them. The artist wanted people to create sentences or phrases using these word cards
and place it on the audio box in front of them. What really surprised me was how the audio box knew which card was being placed 
down. What was even more interesting was that she had not only the English language but Spanish and Vietnamese as well.
