The exhibits we saw were very different from what I expected. I was pleasely surprised, I really liked how abstract and mixed media they were. There were many sculptures and 3D pieces that continued down to the floor. I also liked the downstairs exhibit that was interactive and said the words you selected aloud. I really liked the stories behind the artwork on the third floor, I felt like many of the pieces could have a movie centered around them. They were all very creative.

My favorite piece from the museum was “A World Lost” because of the extreme detail. I like how the piece extends down to the floor with sand and objects. The small shells and changes of color and texture in the sand are small details that enhance the impact of the piece. There are even little people standing on the sand that you would not notice at a simple glance. Each and every detail is intricately placed, down to the direction each strand of thread is pointing to enhance the full impact of the piece. 

I also like the message this piece is portraying. An island is injured and falling apart because of the pollution that humans have carelessly discarded. I think it brings attention to the global warming problems and overall pollution we are causing this planet. I believe this piece makes a statement to all who see it and will change their actions towards the earth’s wellbeing.
