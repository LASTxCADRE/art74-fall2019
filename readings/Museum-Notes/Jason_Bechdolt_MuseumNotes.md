Inside the glass case there is a collection of pieces that appeared to have been constructed from old knicknacks like buttons, pieces of rope, and other random objects. These objects feel like objects that represent the past in a nostalgic way, and also remind me of those books where you would look for specific objects in a busy image.
The exhibit with the sand on the floor looks like a riverbed laced with the impact of humanity. The fact that the exhibit was created right here and exists only here gives it a raw and exclusive energy, the fact that it is so fragile makes it seem like more of a privaledge to get to see it
Another area I liked is the one with the monstrous looking structures that were reminsicent of the terrors of the deep ocean, I like that they used normal, unpainted metal as attachments, making the art feel more like a machine than a scuplture. The one serpent that has the globe in it's mouth gives a great scale of its size and threat. I also liked the one that was more human like, that appeared to be dragging or holding down all those strings that went over the balcony.
