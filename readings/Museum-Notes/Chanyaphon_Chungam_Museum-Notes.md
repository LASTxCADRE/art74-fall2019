The current exhibitions on display were very interesting and had a wide range of mediums and styles. In the bottom floor there was an interactive exhibition that was something that I hadn't seen yet. The interactive cards were very fun to interact and my favorite in that exhibit. I appreciated how they were in English, Spanish, and Vietnamese. One of the displays that I thoroughly found interesting was Beta Space by Pae White. I loved how it encompassed the whole room and the different textures and designs. It had beautiful colors and I think displaying it as winding through the gallery was a good way to showcase it rather than just hanging it up on a wall. However, my favorite display was Take me...to the Palace of love by Banerjee. I particularly loved this piece because of the work overall. Iâ€™m sure that it was made from saran wrap but it looked so beautiful the way the artist designed it. I loved the idea of it being a palace and the color really stood out and caught your eye. I especially loved being able to walk into it and examining the centerpiece up close.
