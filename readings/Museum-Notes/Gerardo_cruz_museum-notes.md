The artworks that resonated with me were the ones that were part of Immigration and Identity by Banerjee because it is about
how immigrants are treated and the negative views citizens have towards them. In one of the piece of artworks it shows a woman
that looks ill and its surrounded with green looking viruses with demon faces floating around the artwork. In the background
there is a map or blue print of a city with red stains in different places. It reminds me how it is believed that immigrants 
bring illnesses and viruses to the place they are immigrating to; so they are not welcomed anywhere and are given a bad 
representation as a human being. The humanity from the immigrant is taken away and the only things that stay are the 
stereotypes and negative comments towards them.
