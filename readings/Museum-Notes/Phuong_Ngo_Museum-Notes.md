I really enjoy this trip to San Jose Museum of Arts. The exhibits I saw make me really surprise of the great amount of arts world that the artist can make, including the complicated sculptures and the paintings, when each one of them carry its own meaning and messages. 

The piece that stroked me the most was “A World Lost”. It carries a very powerful message about climate change, and how people are trying to cope up with it. The story of her visit to Bangladesh was illustrated simply but meaningfully, with those sand on the ground and scattered plastic cups along with many other materials on it. She also use small human figures to show how little the human beings are, comparing to the natural world. The acrylic paintings on the wall also caught my eyes. They look very unique when coupling with watercolor paper in a traditional South East Asia art style, each one tell a different story about the abnormal lives.
