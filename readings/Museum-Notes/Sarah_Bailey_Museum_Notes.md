My overall experience of the San Jose Art Museum was an interesting experience. The first main exhibit had a childish or nostalgic feel to it, with various piecing resembling toys. There was also a large fabric canvas cast across the exhibit, which reminded me of hte quilts my mother used to make in her free time. The second part of the exhibit had a more abstract look and feel. The materials used in the sculptures littering this exhibit were a variety of seashells and items such as lightbulbs. The materials used conveyed to me that the artist may have been addressing the issue of ocean pollution, or just referencing the ocean in general and how odd it can be.
