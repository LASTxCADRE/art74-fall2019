In the San Jose Museum my favorite art piece was the Winter Flower by Rina Banerjee as the sleek black tentacle like arms that extend out of the pine coke like center remind of the famous Venom symbiote from Marvel comics as if it were hiding underneath a rock and is now ready to punch coming at all directions from the center to entrap the victim to be the next host. The contrast works really well tpgether as well since it's black and white with a bit of red and brown.
