San Jose Museum of Art field trip response. 

Pae White’s Betta Space is potentially one of the most fascinating, intriguing exhibits I’ve ever experienced. I loved the transformation of the room and the playfulness of the display. Pae White was able to "break up" the room wihtout making it feel claustrophobic; instead, I felt enveloped in a maze of glittering imagery.

My favorite piece by Pae White was a tapestry titled: foreverago. Foreverago is a luxurious, 127 foot, digitally rendered artwork that depicts insects and plants with metallic threads. Through her imagery, White is inviting the viewer into her imagination and revealing a fascination for bugs and the plants they consume. I enjoyed how the Tapestry encouraged the viewer to travel in a unique way through the gallery. The metallic weave brightened up the room and gave the space a fantastical aura.
