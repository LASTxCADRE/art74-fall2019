The fourth reading was interesting because AR is a completely new and evolving field. I still have a hard time trying to wrap my head around it. This article was a lot more articulate than the previous ones. While I feel like the other articles were more about the art, this article was kind of more about the frame work of AR. This article was really hard to read and did not help my already unclear vision within AR. However, we did just start going over the png AR face masks and I think this project will be very interesting.
