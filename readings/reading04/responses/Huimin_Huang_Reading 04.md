After reading this article, my mind was changed. Before, I thought AR is a thing that far away from us, because when I 
selsom heard AR and play AR. But now, I feel AR is actually everywhere. And I was kind of mixed up the AR, VR and MR, I thought
they are the same. In this article, it gave me a clearly definition. AR is real environment plus virtual stuff, and VR is 
virtual environment and virtual stuff. In a word, Virtual reality (VR), seeing scenes and characters are all fake, is to put 
your consciousness into a virtual world. Augmented reality (AR), the scenes and parts of the characters that are seen are true 
and part of the fake, bringing virtual information into the real world.And MR is AR and VR.

Now the technology is being strong, I think we will bring AR to our world one day. We won't need to use the AR machine into the
AR world.
