  By reading this article, I get a better sense of the histroy of AR and how it creates a new view for us to view art. Before reading this article, I actually consider AR as a technology, because I thought AR are mostly create by coding. AR is actually like a new field for artist to explore and create more arts with it and nowadays AR have been in the important part of our life. Like snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook. I found AR as an amazoning tool to view the art we create and in the article, the author also mentions "With AR art, a digital installation e/merges into the physical experiene of our bodies as we wander within its invisibly annotated milieu." I think AR provide us a better opportunties to experience the things we may not be able to achevice in real life.
   After reading the article, there's a question raise in my head: Could AR replace the real world? Could we just wear a glaases there can be view as how we wanted? and do all the things that we couldn't do in the world of AR? Although we have VR now, but I think it will be soon that we can live in a world that we "create." I also think the AR pop-up book "Who's Afraid of Bugs" is very useful for kids to learn. So in the other hand, AR can also educate children.
