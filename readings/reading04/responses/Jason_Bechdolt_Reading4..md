AR(Augmented reality) art is essentially 3D images and artworks that are geolocated to a specific spot, and can be viewed in that spot through devices such as phones. Different from virtual reality in that you can still see real objects in that spot as well, a mixture of reality and fantasy. The artworks are either geolocated to a specific location or coded into a qr code nearby, by a team of artists and programmers. It is also stated that the devices used to view these artworks are like sensory organs in a way. The article also mentions that in a way these digigtals artworks are more tangible than physical works due to geolocated objects being unmovable without recoding 
Tamiko Thiel is renowned for her work of creating one of the first navigable 3D grahic worlds. One of her most notable works is a gold cage in tiananmen square and two other locations that appears to trap the viewer. Viewing it has become prohibited in some of these locations yet it remains anyway as a reminder of the governments restrictions of their citizens rights. Some of her other works include a rain of gold coins over wall street, a superimposing of wildflowers, watermills and windmills on to a city landscape, and  even an overlay of what a city would look like after oceans rise.
Helen Papagiannis is an artist that rather than geolocating, links her art to a QR code or a particular object, so that when the object is viewed with a device the art will appear. such as a butterfly coming from a hanging art piece or a childrens books that comes to life once its images are viewed. Her eventual goal is to integrate touch sensory elements in her work.
Many meseums have begun to integrate Augmented reality in their exhibits, as well as interactive functions that allow visitors to superimpose their images or videos unto exhibits. Some museums even superimpose an old image unto its location in present day to create a fusion of past and present. Augmented reality is a modern way of archiving art and human progress, and a super important technology for those in that field of research
