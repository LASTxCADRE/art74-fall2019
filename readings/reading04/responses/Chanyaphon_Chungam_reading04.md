In the reading Invisible Visualities, the article explores the meaning of augmented reality and the mechanics of what makes it different from the traditional art styles we know of. Augmented reality, or commonly known as AR, is a form of art that complicates traditional notions of the visual arts. There is no tangible mediums such as paints or paper in AR art. It is all done digitally using geolocation or programmed coding to place visual digital information into the physical world. AR is a type of mixed reality, not to be confused with virtual reality. AR overlays a virtual world onto the view of the real world, so the viewer experiences both at the same time. AR art brings a new twist on traditional art and the way we view the physical world. 
I didn’t know much about augmented reality before reading this article. The most knowledge I had about AR was with filters on social media apps such as Snapchat and Instagram. There is a much bigger world of AR art than just face filters. I looked up a few of the artists that were mentioned and while most of their works looked simple in still life, I know bringing it to life is a detailed task. I personally think this is a very interesting form of art and I’d love to create something of my own one day. It looks so complex that that is the only reason I might be a little terrified of trying. However, I think this is an amazing form of art and I’d love to learn more about it.
