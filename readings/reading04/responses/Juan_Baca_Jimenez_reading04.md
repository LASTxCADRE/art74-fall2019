Virtual reality is more like mixed media, it involves cutting a piece of the world and immersing it to a virtual world. Augmented reality focuses on overlaying a virtual world into the real world. Smartphones act as a mediating device that networks invisible art onto the spacial dimension. Ecological interaction brings virtual objects to life and virtual life forms to the perception space of the body. When bringing AR to life, the devices act as multi sensory interface organs to augment the body's skin. 

Final AR art form is AR performance art. When someone walks through the augmented studio space. He interacts with the AR dancers invinsible to him, but visible to the viewers screen. The person holding a viewing device and see the real man walking and the AR dancers. AR Art starts a new type of aesthetic seeing a nee domain of sensibility characterized by invincible visualilties. AR matters, it exhibits and is an exhibition of contemporary (techno) cultural expression.
