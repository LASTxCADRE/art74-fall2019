As I began "Invisible Visualities" which explainedr what augmented reality is, the first question that came to my mind concerned what augmented reality both has and lacks in its limits. On one hand, augmented reality cannot grant viewers the inherently physical aspect of some visual art. We can see texture, but we cannot feel it. On the other hand, augmented reality does not have the same limits that installation visual art often has. Many artists have wanted to put their artwork on specific areas, however, due to a number of reasons which are either largely environmental or legally not possible. Augmented reality is a solution to those issues and opens those areas for virtual installations; this is a major positive of augmented reality that overshadows the physical negative of technology art. Another aspect of the reading I liked, albeit small, was the explanation of the difference between augmented reality and virtual reality since the two are often mixed up.   
Upon completing the reading, my interest in augmented reality only heightened. I'm curious about mixing and mashing various digital elements with augmented reality. One of the points that the reading quickly passes over that caught my interest is the use of other artwork with augmented reality. The example the reading gives us is using augmented reality that interacts when an art piece is shown through the lens. Although it is an interesting and radical development in the artworld, it brings up questions concerning the use of augmented reality on artwork. There is no issue if its an augmented reality on the artist's own physical gallery artwork, but what if it was one artist's augmented reality on another's physical art piece? Though it does not alter the artwork in its original condition, will some artists be concerned with the role that their artwork plays in augmented or virtual reality? As we  continue to develop and grow our experiences with augmented reality and visual art, these are just a few of the questions and concerns that come alongisde our rapid technology development.
