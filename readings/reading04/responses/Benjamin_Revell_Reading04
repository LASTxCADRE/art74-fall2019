  AR has always been something that always sounded cool. Seeing art exhibits
that display AR around the world seems very interesting. AR at the surface level
seems to be more interactive than its physical art counterpart. AR art can be 
seen up close or from miles away and all you would need is your phone. Compared
to VR, AR seems much more immersive. However, my experience with AR has been
very bland.

   AR is something that has a ton of potential, but just cant be realized with
modern tech. VR was something that had that problem in the 90's with the virtual
boy. It was Nintendo's attempt at VR with the technology they had and it fell flat
since it was only two screens displayed in goggles. It was clunky and it made people
sick. Modern AR isnt really something that makes the users sick, but it also isn't anything
game changing. Holding my phone up to my face doesn't make me immersed, it just makes
me feel like im looking at my phone. With the shoddy gps tracking and gyroscope features
on most smartphones, sometimes the AR will glitch out and further take me out of 
the immersion. As tacky as Google Glass was, it was the closest thing that we had to 
true AR. Hopefully in the future people can make a better and more accessible version
of AR, whether it be through glasses, contacts, or smart glass. Looking at GPS landmarked
art with AR seems really cool, but looking at it through my phone doesnt impress
me any more than if it was just a video.
