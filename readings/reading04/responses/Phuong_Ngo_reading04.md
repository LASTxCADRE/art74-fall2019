The reading starts by showing the differences between augmented reality and virtual reality. I often see them similar to each other, as they both relate to the virtual world. But now when I learn about the concepts, I can easily see the differences. Virtual reality is more like disconnecting you from real life and getting you immerse to its own virtual world, while augmented reality helps creating an overlay of that virtual world and put it into your real world so that you can get to experience both at the same time – without having to cut yourself off from the real world.
While completing the reading, I get to know more about how AR works, and it really makes me more curious about the arts that based on augmented reality. The way it work requires a viewer who basically put him or her into the center of the surrounding. AR create and diverse the possibilities of arts by putting virtual world into the real world, changing our point of view about the physical world. The beauty of it is lying in its ability to bringing the arts to life, in various way, with no obstacles like physical laws or space. It amaze me to know that the artists also use AR technique to conduct a message about global warming, by surrounding public spaces with images and animations of flood with rising waters – a result of climate change. AR pop-up books are also a creative way to learn new things by using dimensional images to approach knowledge easier, which recently has been used a lot for children to learn about the wildlife, the animals, planets... I really agree with the saying “AR is like a new form of seeing”. It create so many possibilities, to observe and experience life as a more different way than before. It’s like a parallel world that exist among us that we cannot touch but can be seen and felt clearly.
