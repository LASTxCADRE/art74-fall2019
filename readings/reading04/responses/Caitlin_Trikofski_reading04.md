My first thoughts on augmented reality art are contradicting and complex. I like viewing other peoples AR art work, yet wouldn’t like my own art being AR. I prefer more hands on art so that I can feel the texture of a piece and get a feel for its real life size. Though, I know that AR art is very unique, intricate and spontaneous, there’s so much you’re able to do with it. I also found it interesting on all the ways people found they could make AR art on and what devices allow them to do certain things. I wasn’t aware of how people could use augmented reality on their phones now without it being too much for the device to handle.

After reading through the notes section in the article, I read that AR was helping people with disabilities or phobias. This is a new concept to me as well since I had only ever been introduced to AR as in a form of a game, an art form, or model system. I think this is a very efficient and effective approach to helping people with social anxiety disorders, arachnophobia, posttraumatic stress disorders and general pains. All in all, I think learning about AR is going to be a new, unique and fun challenge for me.
