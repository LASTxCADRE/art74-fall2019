An interesting aspect is that the direct focus is neither on the effects of the computuing or the unveiling in technology but rather on the distinct particularities of Visual Art. Using the definitio. of both Virtual Art where you cut yourself off from the real world but in AR you incoroporate both the real and digitial world mixing the two which gave it an interesting POV since Virtual Reality already seemd cool, but combined with real life would make it seem better at least in my opinion. 

AR Art does sound pretty risky with it being said to mimic the bodies organs to augment performance and even needing extensions attached and I no longer feel as comfortable trying it out as I did beforehand.

With Helen Papa Giannaisis mentioning they utilized QR codes into AR art, it opens up a new branch of art with AR art that I find very unique and perplexing.
