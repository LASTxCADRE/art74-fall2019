While I was reading this article I learned what AR was and it said it's a form of artistic expression that complicates traditional notions of the visual art. AR art is used via movile computing devices like smartphones. Some AR art is displayed in private galleries and public squares. It also stated that if one of the networked parts in the fails, the art does not become active or activated. AR art spans the arc of public and private, of presentation and performances, and of interaction and subversion. I find AR art to be so amazing and attention catching due to it having to use technology to see most of it. Most of the AR art is virtual and alot of younger people love it and adults think it's amazing. 

Touchable AR tends to perform a unique aesthetic expression and initiates a different type of experience for the viewer. It amazed me how AR art can be made i different formats like in 2012 the only way view the AR was with a device because there was dancers in a studio but it could only be viewed with a device. AR art is so amazing there's so many ways to make it and it's absolutely awesome because it's dimensional and it's something new that not many people know how to do and it's just beatiful.AR art cannont be seen by naked eye, the must be seen through a device like a phone. The art coexists, invisibility, with with the physical space of the body even if we are not directly experiencing its sensorial presence.
