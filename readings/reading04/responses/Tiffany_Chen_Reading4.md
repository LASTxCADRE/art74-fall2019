In reading 4, I learned what AR is and what's the differece about augmented reality and vertual reality. I honestly thought they
were the same because they are both computer generated images. But in this reading I learned that AR is just an image that's taken
from a phone and it's a still image. It allows viwers to see the real world in a composite way. VR is a whole another different
thing. It's a three dimensional image where you can see the image and makes it look real when you use special equipments. I think
it's really cool that humans have created this new technology. This realing was interesting because it's not really about art but
about the art inside the technology.
