AR (Augmented Reality) Art matters and is a valid form of cultural expression. Although it uses an “unconventional” form of creation,
using the digital format can bring to life ones piece without limitations. It can bring the viewer into the art piece itself. 
It can bring the artwork to life. When one firsts looks upon the piece, they are not seeing the finished product. 
Only until it is viewed through the digital format do you see what the artist creation is. The creativity is limitless. 
Several other mediums are using AR to create their works. Dance is another art that is using AR. There are even museums who are showing works of art through AR.
