Reading four mostly introduces and foceses on AR or augmented reality, as well as its cultural significance. AR doesnt use any canvases or papers, rather it is placed inside a tangible sphere through a mediated unveiling. AR is different from VR or virtual reality as rather than completely cutting off reality, it mergess reality and the virtual world together. AR is usually accessed through a phone or similar medium, or a QR code. The image is then usually is projected through the devices' camera
Most AR exhibits are bound to a specific place through GPS. Like tangible art, it has to be moved when needed, and usually requires recoding. Digital artists aren't the only ones who work on AR art, it is a team of artists and progmrammers. Some important artists and researchers in AR are Tamiko Thiel, Mark Skwarek, and Heken papgiannis.
