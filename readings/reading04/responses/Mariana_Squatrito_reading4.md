Reading Response to Invisible Visualities

The reading Invisible Visualities introduces and defines the new art form known as Augmented Reality or AR. AR has emerged in the artworld as a new medium that challenges the idea of or desire for material things. AR is also often used as a form of Art Activism, such as Tamiko Thiel’s Jasmine Rain Birdcage.

In the past, art has been defined as the result of human creativity transforming real world objects and elevating them into an ethereal, unknown realm. AR acts in this way in that it is transforming the real world through our new and advanced technology. Theorist N. Katherine Hayles describes AR by stating that we are able to see a new dynamic quality that emerges between the interplay of the real physical world and conceptual content, which is then interpreted by the viewer or user. 

However, AR is not to be confused with Virtual Reality (VR). According to Invisible Visualities, Virtual Reality works to remove the user from the real world and immerse them in a virtual “fantasy world”. AR works with real life objects and creates overlays or filters that can be seen through a smart device. Thus, AR is invisible and unobstructive until it’s made visible through the lens of our technological world.
