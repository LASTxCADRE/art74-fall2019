Reading number four focuses on Augmented and virtual reality. I didn't know there was any difference between these two types of reality but this article helped me understand. Augmented reality is a mixture of reality, it overlaps the real and virtual world. Virtual reality is very different from this, it cuts off the real world entirely. You are fully encompassed in the virtual reality with no connection back to the physical one. I find this very interesting because as cool as virtual reality is, it scares me. I don't like the idea of being cut off from the physical world, I feel like I may get trapped in this virtual world, even though that is probably impossible. 

This article taught me that AR can help you experience and understand world issues. Many artists nowadays are using AR to use a strong visual impact on their audience and convey their message. I think this is a very interesting change in pace from the regular protest and social media posts that have become so common. I also learned that you can use AR in correlation with a physical piece of artwork. For example, overlaying virtual reality on a sculpture. I was surprised that museums are beginning to embrace AR because I tend to think of them as old school, and simply focused on oil paintings from decades ago. The most interesting thing to me in this reading was the part about AR in the dance world. I have been dancing my entire life and I am struggling to keep it up during college and find time to go to classes. With AR dance classes I could learn the choreography simply with an instructor and my peers and feels as if I am really inside a dance studio!
