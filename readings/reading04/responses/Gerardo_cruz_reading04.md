 I like the way AR art involves the body to be part of the process and experience, instead of isolating the viewer as virtual
 reality does. There appears to be more in touch with the artwork when the viewer is included in the process of the interaction
 between a technological device and the real life, and an electronic device is the bridge that brings the virtual artworks into
 our existence and allowing us to see the virtual world. 

There has to be a human interaction with the technology in order for the virtual artworks to exist and move around. Similar as
the physical art-pieces the AR art exists in a certain space and needs to be recoded in order to switch and occupy a different
space. Its very interesting on how the artifact, device, and viewer is needed for the artwork to come to life, and all three 
of them are essential for the art to be manifested.
