So the Manifesto basically talked about how making a mesh was were cruelty and creativity are reconciled in the appropriation of all planetary matter to inovate on biological prototypes. What I found really interesting from the cookbook was the Webcamera Obscura. It really caught my attention because the 3D model was used on a computer to cover the camera.It's basically a tool that helps reclai privacy.

The Webcamera Obscura is a masking device for laptop webcams that can be used to rewrite, reform and re-event the images and private spaces. This really caught my attention because a lot of people wamnt somehting like the Webcam Obscura to put on laptop cameras to get more privacy. I always see people with paper and tape on their cameras so i feel like this model would be so beneficial.
