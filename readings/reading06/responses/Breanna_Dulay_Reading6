# 3D Additivist Cookbook: Surface Breeding 
Looking through the 3D Additivist Cookbook, one of the projects that caught my attention was *Surface Breeding* by Belen Zahera. 
The reading gives a brief introduction into what *Surface Breeding* is, explaining that it is, "Using selective breeding to create
new surfaces of signification". What exactly does that mean? Zahera explains that it is taking the surface of an artifact and
domesticating it so that it evolves and changes by itself. I understood this to mean taking any surface or any 3D physical artifact, 
perhaps one of the more unconventional surfaces, and treating it like a living, evolving organism. In doing so, the surface of the 
physical artifact creates new meaning and new uses for itself. However, one thing to note is that both physical and digital surfaces and 
artifacts are on equal footing; one is not considered higher than the other.  
I was drawn to *Surface Breeding* first because of the artwork that was displayed. The images presented for the project include an organic,
abstract 3D form which caught my attention because of its unfamiliar nature and form. Additionally, I found the reading to be rather 
insightful because of how it described what surface breeding was and its progression process. Zahera compared it to bringing a 2D form 
and evolving it to a 3D form and giving it life. By doing that, it changes it use and meaning which had me interested in how objects and
surfaces change over time and create new uses and new meanings, as stated in the project description.
