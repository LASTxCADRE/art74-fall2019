I thought that this 3D environmental model was interesting. This project is a series of virtual environments situated within Anthropocenic narrative  of environmental destruction in the name of digital preservation and virtual resolution. Just looking at the artwork, I can notice a lake, mountains, fields, and a small town. Looks like a small world or community displayed into a 3D artificial  model. It's cool seeing it in a 3D artificial perspective rather than the realistic form.
