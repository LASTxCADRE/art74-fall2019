In reading six, I notice there are a lot of vocabulary words, and I don't know what most of it means. But something I learned from 
this reading is that 3D printing uses black plastic and I thought that was intereating but also weird. I also find it weird that they
were talking about torture machines and sex organs and sex machines. I don't get how that can relate to 3D printing. 

Something I find interesting was the 3D printing faces. I thought it was really cool how it can copy someone's face amd cam recognized
them. Also 3D printing can work on many other things and it's really easy. I thought it would be diffucult because it seems impossible 
but it's not.
