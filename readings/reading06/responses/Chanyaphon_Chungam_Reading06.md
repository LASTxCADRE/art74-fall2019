In the reading, The 3D Additivist Manifesto, called to bring attention to the need of acceleration of 3D printers and other technologies to their absolute limits and beyond into the realm of the speculative and the inquisitive. The writers seek to express the potential encoded into every one of the 3D printer’s gears. From the reading, it seems that the writers would like to expand the public’s knowledge of 3D printing more. Which I can agree on because I don’t know much about 3D printing but I would definitely like to learn more about it. It still seems very new and complex. 


One thing in the cookbook that really caught my attention was the Print Green section. I thought it was really interesting how instead of 3D printing cartridges, organic mixtures are used, which become green with time. The finished results are printed 3D models with capability of ‘turning green’. I like the message of the design which is think green before you print and it looks very aesthetically pleasing.
