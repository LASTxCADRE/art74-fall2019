The manifesto was quite interesting to read, It seemed straight out of a sci fi universe with all its talk of quantum entanglement, nanotech and machine sentience. It feels like the manifesto of a cult, that is rebelling against a future government, considering they request the ability to encode messages, create weapons and other methods of defense, and strangest of all, they want access to creating torture machines, actually no, the interspecies sex organ part is weirder. This whole manifesto feels like the work of very bold and edgy people and I'm not sure how I feel about it. Kind of seems like they want complete freedom to create chaos through their inventions. Makes me want to watch a sci fi TV show.
One thing I found both unsettling and cool from the cookbook is the part about 3d printed faces. Although it's not too difcult to see through such a disguise, The fact that it can trick faceial recognition software seems like it would be pretty fun. I remember in the recent Mission impossible movie they actually had a technology that could create near perfect copies of peoples faces. Man just imagine the pranks you could do with stuff like this, hoo boy. real talk though this could cause some serious problems if it was perfected. something similar that I recall hearing about, is technology that can imitate a persons voice very closely, just imagine the forged soundbites tht could ruin peoples career.
