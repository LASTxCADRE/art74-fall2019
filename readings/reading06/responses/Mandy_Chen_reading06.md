I read the 3D print simulator from "The 3D Additvist Cookbook" it talks about how 3D priniting is expensive and by using the 3D print simulator, we can look through the 3D object and make sure it's good to go. We can also use the simulator to replace the process of 3D printing,so we can use less material to create more.In fact, the 3D simulator actually looks like the real 3D printing itself. The author was right about "Do we need to touch something, to own something, to value it? Does it need to be constructd from a finite natural resouce to participate in a market?" It reminds me of back when I was High school, there is a 3D printing workshop, not only it takes a lot of times to print their object out and the material and the printing mechanies were expensive. I think it will be very usefully to have the 3D simulator.
