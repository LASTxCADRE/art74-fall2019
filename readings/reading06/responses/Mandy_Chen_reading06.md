     I read the 3D print simulator from "The 3D Additvist Cookbook" it talks about how 3D priniting is expensive and by using the 3D print simulator, we can look through the 3D object and make sure it's good to go. We can also use the simulator to replace the process of 3D printing,so we can use less material to create more.In fact, the 3D simulator actually looks like the real 3D printing itself. The author was right about "Do we need to touch something, to own something, to value it? Does it need to be constructd from a finite natural resouce to participate in a market?" It reminds me of back when I was High school, there is a 3D printing workshop, not only it takes a lot of times to print their object out and the material and the printing mechanies were expensive. I think it will be very usefully to have the 3D simulator.
     The other benefit that the 3D simulator has is the model will never age or get damage by time and maybe in the future we can use it on our phone. It also decreases the use of human labor. I can already imagine that we are using the sofeware to create what we want and we have thounds of different materials that we can choose and view our final model at anyplace and share to the world.
