The 3D Additivist Manifesto was quite simple in their statements once you get past all of the complex vocabulary they use.
They request that within the medium of 3D printing, much like the invention of the printing press or other digital media,
we discover all of it's uses (intentional or not). We need to reverse engineer 3D printing and it's effects in order to 
understand it better. We are at the dawn of 3D printing and eventually, like mankind wishes to achieve, we will improve
the technology and eventually be enveloped by it. They say that the same technology that will "emancipate us will eradicate us"

I decided to read about the "Pistil" section on the 3D Additivist Cookbook. At first the images it shows just looks like 
a Lego flower but it's use is actually really interesting. As 3D technology is getting more and more advanced, the threat that
guns will start to be printed on these devices increases. The 3D printed Pistil is designed to deactivate a gun. The Pistil is 
first inserted into the barrel of a gun and then an epoxy is mixed and then inserted into the top of the Pistil with a syringe.
The epoxy then binds to the gun and the Pistil and then renders it the gun useless. The creator of the Pistil knows that the 
only thing that can possibly prevent the damage of a gun is to find something that can completely disable it.
