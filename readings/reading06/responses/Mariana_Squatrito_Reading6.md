Reading Response to The Additivist Manifesto

The 3D Additivist Manifesto conveys an urgency to push technology into realms beyond its normal function. It encourages anarchy, and creativity in reverse-engineering. The Manifesto states that we must fabricate the glitch and embrace it in order to fully understand the technological process of 3D printing. The Manifesto declares that if we do not challenge technological limits, if we are not aggressive in our pursuit of changing material manipulation, then our realm of technological possibilities will not increase.   
  
What I found interesting was this idea of Digital Destiny. Digital renderings are continually being created, updated, saved or discarded. This caused me to question the purpose of digital creations in the real world. When a creation remains behind a screen there is still a separation between the viewer and object, but what happens when that object is printed? What happens when VR allows the viewer to step into the digital realm to experience the object in its “natural” element? Digital creations would not exist if not for human invention and interaction. Therefore, it is clear that the destiny of digital renderings is for them to be experienced and challenged by humans.
