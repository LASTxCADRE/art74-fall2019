For reading response six I read the chapter on the perils of pursuing 3D printing as a hobby. I found this chapter very interesting because I have never seen 3D printing as simply a hobby for someone. This chapter clearly lays out how it can be seen as both someone's hobby as well as someones job. I think 3D printing is a great catalyst for exploration and discovery. I think it will change a lot in the technology department and later discoveries in every type of job.

On the other hand, I believe that anything can be somones hobby. Someone could have 3D printing as their hobby since it is an easy way to tap into your creative and technical powers. I see nothing wrong with someone using 3D printing as their artistic and creative outlet, plus it can be incredibly fun to play around with!
