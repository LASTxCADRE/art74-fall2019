The reading on glitch art was very surprising to me. I have never thought of a glitch as a piece of art. I learned a lot from this video, for example, I always saw glitches as a bad thing. My understanding was that only a computer science major had the technology and knowledge to create a glitch, whereas I learned today someone as inexperienced as myself can too.
Glitch art is when you create something unexpected out of a program that does not normally do such a command. I also assumed a glitch was a mistake but in this video, I learned that a glitch is an unexpected moment in the system that causes attention to that system. I still do not fully understand the difference between glitch art and a glitch but it was defined in the video is anytime an artist intentionally leverages a moment by either retention lysing or provoking a glitch. Glitch art is deliberately making glitches to convey something to your audience.
I always assume the people that created glitches were doing it to simply break the rules. They wanted to lash out and show other people what they could do however the video showed me that glitch art is not for the sake of breaking the rules but for the experiences and discoveries you make along the way within creating your art. Glitch art is taking an image from one piece of software and moving it into another that does not support that image. Youâ€™re consciously doing things the wrong way in the wrong software to see how it will manipulate the image.  The glitch you make on a piece of software will change in time as that software changes however the artifact you have made while we stay the same. This video is very eye-opening to me and I am glad that we have watched it in a college-level art class when I never understood that things like glitches could be even conceived as a piece of art.
