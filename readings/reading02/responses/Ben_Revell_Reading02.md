Thoughts on Glitch[Art]v2.0 is a explanitory video essay on the art movement known as Glitch Art.
Nick Briz proceeds to explain the "why" and "how" of glitch art. Glitch Art is manipulating 
different forms of digital media using (at least currently) computer programs. While the word
glitch might imply that something has gone wrong, glitch art is not an error. Everything within
the glitch art sphere is created intentionally. Glitch art can be created in myriad of ways. 
Most image files will be opened with a default photo viewing application or they can be edited
with the user's photo editing application of choice. Glitch art subverts the intended application
to edit photos by opening the photo with a text editor, an audio editor, or any other application
that can read the information of a photo. Then changes can be made within those incorrect editors
which will output a crazy looking photo. Depending on how you edit these files, the output of 
the final photo can vary. Different filters within photo and video editors can be applied
to photos or videos to mimick the look of glitch art, they are not glitch art. 

I really enjoyed this video essay. Comparing this to previous papers that I've read about different
art topics, the information that the webpage was able to put out was very comprehensive and 
more importantly understandable. The look of the page was also quite interesting as all of the
information, notes, and images that popped up during the essay could be moved around, expanded, 
or minimized which added to the entertainment of the essay. Glitch art has always had a cool
look to me and maybe in the future I'll attempt to create some of my own depending on how 
difficult the process actually is.
