be a glitch. This is very cool because I never knew you can open an image and mess with it. I also didn’t know that glitch is something you
can do purposely, I always think it’s something that happened if you break the computer or something. I always think if something that 
glitches, there has to be something wrong or it’s an error but it turns out it’s really something that you did that caused a glitch and not
the computer breaking down. What I didn’t expect was that people think glitch is an art. I personally don’t really like it but I think it’s
really cool that people can create something like that.
