After watching the hypermedia essay on what Glitch Art is, I feel as though I have a better understanding as to what classifies as Glitch 
art and why it came about.I was so very appreciative of his re-defining of Glitch art as it has changed over such a short amount of time,
and that a glitch in a computer is defined technically as an 'error', but glitch art is very intentional and has taken file types and just
renedered them to get a different outcome. Not only do glitch artists make their work for aesthetic reasons but also more likely for 
political reasons, to voice their point of view on what is happening in the world. I also learned that glitch art equals an ethic and that are 
right ways and wrong ways to create glitch art. For example using a filter to make a photo look glitched is not considered part of the glitch
art group, it has to be altered from the inside-out. 

I also was very interested in what he had to say on more of the 'politix' of glitch and how we have been so affected by technology, it may seem
as though we are the ones 'affecting the world' but we are the ones being affected by it. Technology and media are our environments and
it is almost inevitable to avoid it. The commercial about the new iPad is advertising it's versatility and ability to change the way people create, produce,
and learn. They say it's invisible, and becomes apart of the person using it. 
But this actually made me feel more frightened then interested... People have become so used to relying on technology that we become lost in the 
world (the natural world) that we can't live on our own. I mean, technology is going to be growing up with us in a sense and maybe always around
so I can see why He mentioned that it has become our environment but I don't want to be surrounded by technology. It's not natural, being an animal ourselves; 
we are very intelligent and don't have to live as cavepeople but also, when is the 'future' in technology become too far and go over the edge?

I was relieved to here his opinion on the ad and how he said they are not executing technology well as they are just looking for followers and
our money.
