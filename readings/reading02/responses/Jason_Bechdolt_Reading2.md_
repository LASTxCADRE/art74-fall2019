Im doing this over a day late so I have already gotten the chance to experience the details of part one, so I'll focus on parts 2-4. The conditional statements section essentially Cleared up misconceptions about what glitch art is. It is essentially a style, and concept of creation based on the idea of using an application in a way that it is not meant to be used to produce an unexpected, but intentional, effect. I think it's cool how this concept essentially branches across many different application and has limitless potential in that way. The politics part is super interesting, Ive been watching a show called Black mirror that delves into the way that technology is effecting us and could effect us in the future, so this section is up my alley. I never really deeply considered the absurdity of the way that Apple limits the ways in which we are able to use their devices, this also applies to nintendo in the way that they make modding very dificult and generally discourage it, which is pretty lame. The main reason I have started to become PC master race is for that reason, Modding and general modification is better on PCs than it is anywhere else. One of my favorite games is super good at supporting mods, and the game has developed to the point where the use of mods is widely accepted among the community due to the ease of it, and how helpful they are to core gameplay.
The concept that Apple also somewhat controls the way we think was also pretty interesting, I have become quite reliant on apple technology, and it has truly integrated itself into my life. That video he displayed about the Ipad definitely felt a bit wrong to me, rather than saying: check out our cool tech, they essentially showed it sliding itself into people's lives replacing the functions of everything else and becoming commonplace. It's not that bad, but it surely does show the level of control that apple is aiming for. The rebelliousness in using things the wrong way is certainly interesting, but I wonder, does that justify jailbreaking and Iphone? Either way discovering more about something through misuse seems like a super fun way to learn about something. Overal Glitch art seems to be a style built upon and representing a sort of rebelliousness and a desire to do things different which definitely appeals to me. I always liked the underdog or the underused, so this sort of thing good be a great project to work on for me.
