After watching the video on Glitch art I already find it very interesting since I too have dabbled in glitch art as well using effects and filters on the app "Picsart" however I am nowhere near as skilled as any of the mentioned artist and can not even edit a video, but I still like the content I created and enjoyed making it. I like that there are meetings for fellow glitch artist where they can meet and if one is ever near me I plan to attend. Although I didn't try it I may attempt to use the glitch art presented in video 1 where he says to drag a jpeg and mess around with the numbers 0 and 1 in the photo he added. In video 2 I found it interesting when mentioned that "glitch=unexpected" and that computers do not make mistakes, humans do. That a computer did what was asked but you are the one at fault for using your glitch. Another thing I found interesting is that glitch art does not equal glitch which is how wikipedia describes it. The narrator goes into detail explaining how it's wrong that a "glitch is an unintentional glitch in the system, but glitch art is intentionally done and that an artist can use the aestheticization to have art artifacts and data bending" using the keyword intentions

Other things unique and interesting about the videos is the way they describe glitchart and compare it to thw wikipedia definition which is wrong. Acoording to wikipedia the definition of glitchart is "glitchart = glitch" however glitch is meant to be unintentional and glitch art is meant to be intentional so it's wrong because the artist seek out the inconsisties and unexpected glitches in their art. Another quote is "using the wrong tool for the job" which is also pretty cool to think about since some people are perfectionist or always try to understand everything with glitchart they can't necessarily create what they want how they want since they are messing with the coding systems of the image and can't predict what's meant to happen by deleting said coding. I also noticed he said there are meetings of sorts where people meet together to find ther fellow glitch artist and although I don't use this art myself yet I plan to attend an event should I ever find the opportunity to.
