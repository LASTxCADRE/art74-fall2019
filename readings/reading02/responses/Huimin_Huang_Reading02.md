Through the video, I know more about glitch art which is take a familiar piece of technology and do something unfamiliar with it. 
So first, we need to copy a file, then open it and edit it. After we save it and re-open it, itâ€™s gonna surprised us.
One thing that changed my mind is, he said glitch doesn't mean error. Before I watched this video, I thought glitch was someone who mixed up and made a mistake.
