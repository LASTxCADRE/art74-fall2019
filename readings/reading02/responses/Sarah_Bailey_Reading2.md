Nick Briz's Thoughts on Glitch [Art] v2.0 is a video essay explaining what  exactly Glitch art is. He explains how to produce glitch art such as grabbing points where a bug or glitch happens and then collect it as a sort of "bug collection," or creating glitches yourself by doing unorthodox things with files. This can sometimes causes some odd bits of data to load. An interesting thing is that the essay becomes interactive, allowing you to test out creating glitch art through a process known as databending.
Briz explains that a glitch doesn't equal an error. Errors are caused by the machine, and glitches are caused by people. In a sense, gltiches are equal to an unexpected result. Glitches arent a file themselves either, rather inside of a file. Each separate program can interpret a glitch differently, though two computers with teh same program and file will give the same result.
