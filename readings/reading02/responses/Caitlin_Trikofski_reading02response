What I learned from the video was that people like Nick Brix are trying to encourage sites to keep their glitches so that 
people can use them to make different forms of art. I initially thought that Nick was going to cover exactly how to make 
glitch art or certain techniques we could use in order to get a certain glitch we may be looking for. Instead he argued
that it's hard for people intruigued by glitch art to make glitch art. He stated how sites like to fix the glitches
people find and make fun out of and then make money off of glitch artists and coders in general by encouragung them
to buy the site in order to use it as a means of their oen personal coding projects.

I can get where Nick is coming from in terms of wanting to keep glitches around so people can learn from them and make things from them
but I think he isn't considering that big sites like the ones he brought up, are looking to portray themselves as proffesional and "error free".
I do however get how much fun that glitches can be, I've had first hand experience with finding gkitches and learning about all of the things you
can do with them. It's honestly really fun and if we do go into how to make glitch art in class, then I'd be quite excited for that
since it's something that interests me, esspecially after the video.
