Reading 02 - Thoughts on Glitch Art

<p> When watching the video on Glitch Art with Nick Briz, my first initial thought was that this was all about coding and how 
glitches are made through code. It kind of gave me a bad vibe at first just because I am unfamiliar with it but once Nick
dove into more details, my mind immediately changed. The quote, "take a familiar piece of technology & do something unfamiliar 
with it" really stood out to me during the whole duration of the video because it leaves the viewer with a different perspective
on life and technology itself. 

<p> Apart from the quote, what I also found interesting throughout the video was the way Nick explained the example of taking a
familiar piece of technology & doing something unfamiliar with it. He explained how opening a jpeg and opening that file in either 
music or text editor that the image would be opened as a glitch. I also was fascinated when he opened the file in text editor
and was manipulating the images code to break it down even more.
