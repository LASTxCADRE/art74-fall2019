    I found this assigned reading to be a perfect blend of informative and engaging because of how the speaker presented this information to the viewers. His presentation followed his advice, to "take a familiar piece of technology and do something unfamiliar with it", which I agree captures what glitch art can look like. I liked the continuing theme of doing something unconventional with technology and glitches, which he demonstrates throughout the multimedia essay by using these glitch elements to make information pop out to the viewers in a sort of interactive manner. One of the parts of the essay that I was most invested in was the very process of creating glitch art. I had this assumption that the glitch art the speaker was talking about was made by using software or apps specifically made for the purpose of creating glitch art. Realizing this was not the case, made me feel as if I'd overlooked what the most simple and most basic of tools can do. Why use an app to make these similar, preset glitch designs when we can create our own individualized glitch art? 
    Another aspect of the video that stands out to me is the concept of finding beauty and inspiration in error. This concept also had me thinking about the differences between error in art and error in our every day lives. For instance, if one was to encounter a file error, a number of people would likely be somewhat frustrated or annoyed since we expect such things to run smoothly. Yet, from an artist's perspective, we are intrigued and enamoured with these errors, finding that it makes the pre-error file a lot more developed than we have thought it could be. I'm excited to try creating glitch art as the speaker describes, by taking something familiar and doing something unconventional with it. With this error and expansive technology, there are limitless boundaries to be crossed in creating something both unfamiliar and beautiful.
