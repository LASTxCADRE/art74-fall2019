While watching this video, I was a little confused at first , but once watching it again it made more sense to me. This information on glitch, glitch art , data bending and glitch literacy is new to me. Nick in the video does emphazise the definition of glitch. Glitch is not a error, it is more so an unexpected moment in the computer system that catches us off guard. I found it to be interesting when Nick explains that when opening an image saved as .jpg or .png it may look one way in one application and it may look another way in another application.He also brings up about that glicth art is different than glitch. Nick says that glitch is an "aestheticization of digital or analog errors, such as artifacts and other "bugs", by either corrupting digital code/data by physically manipualating electronic devices.
