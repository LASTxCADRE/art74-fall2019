While watching this video, I was a little confused at first , but once watching it again it made more sense to me. This information on glitch, glitch art , data bending and glitch literacy is new to me. Nick in the video does emphasize the definition on glitch. Glitch is not a error, it is more so an unexpected moment in the computer system that catches us off guard. I found it to be interesting when Nick explains that when opening an image saved as .jpg or .png it may look one way in one application and it may look another way in another application. He also brings up about that glitch art is different than glitch. Nick says that glitch art is an "aestheticization of digital or analog errors, such as artifacts and other "bugs", by either corrupting digital code/data by physically manipualating electronic devices."

Watching this video opened up my mind and made me feel like I want to learn more about glitch. It's like a whole new world on digital media. Nick emphasizes corrupting files, practicing glitch/glitch art and data bending throughout this video. There are some parts that seem unclear to me like I have no clue what he is talking about and yet there are areas where I do find it fascinating especially the whole glitch art idea.
