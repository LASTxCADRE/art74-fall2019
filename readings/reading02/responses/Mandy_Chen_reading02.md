When I first look at the title "glitch", I thought of the black and white glitch on TV when the signal is working. I love watching this video because it always catch my eyes when informations show up. In the video Nick Briz talks about the glith art and he showed few example of how glitch art is made. When he is showing how to make the glitch picture of the cat, I tried it myself. Even though it didn't work, but I would still try it someday. In the video, he mentions we should use the app we use daily and do something unfamilar with i. I think it's intresting that he mentions that, because people tend to use what the app tell you to do, but hardly think of other way to use it.

Now, I would think glitch is not only showing on an image, but glitch can show up in many ways. Nick's video gives me more ideas, when I need to create design with glitch and think outside the box. Get unfamilar with the things I usually do and create new things. I hope that in designing, I won't just look at the ideas that people already "create", but "glitch" some new ideas.
