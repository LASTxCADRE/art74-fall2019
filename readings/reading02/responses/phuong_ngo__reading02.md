This reading of glitch art is really surprising and engaging from the beginning. Although the whole speech is somehow speedy to me, Nick gives a very clear definition and example. He explains the very easy way to make a glitch art is “to take a familiar piece of technology and do something unfamiliar with it”. The display of the website was very cool made that I feel like I am actually interacting with my own files and windows in desktop. Through his video, I learned a lot of new information. I never thought that a glitch can actually be made on purpose, and someone would make such an error-like glitch into arts. This is basically like choosing the wrong tools for the job and get an unexpected result, then you turn it into something awesome. It is done on purpose but the possibilities are vary. Therefore, I think that glitch arts is like a creative and unintentional way to discover the possible things that can happen to your original one while also making it into arts.
