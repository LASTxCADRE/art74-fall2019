In Glitch[Art]2.0 by Nick Briz, he discusses what glitch art is, how it works and why it is used. He’s a new media artist and he expresses glitch art is taking a familiar piece of technology and do something unfamiliar with it using a program that isn’t meant for that type. I didn’t know much about glitch art before doing this visiting this site. Something important I learned is that glitch art does not exactly equal to an error. It is unexpected. Glitch art can also look different on several applications. That reminds us that new media exists between the files and programs. 

I really like how interactive this essay is. I liked learning about glitch art through videos and being able to click around on the websites rather than reading text. The artist made the information engaging and I liked the topics he covered. I learned that glitch art is much more than just being a “glitch”. There are many types of glitch art such as gifs, videos, websites, furniture, etc. While I find glitch art interesting, I don’t know if I would personally pursue it as a medium I’d want to use or create often. I definitely appreciate it and enjoy some of it but it’s not my preference. But I loved learning about it this way.
