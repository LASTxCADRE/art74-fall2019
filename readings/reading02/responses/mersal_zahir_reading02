In the hypermedia essay, Thoughts on Glitch, the author Nick talks about this form of art called glitch art. He talks about a process called data bending which I found very interesting. It’s a process in which you take and image or some kind of file and try to open it up in a program that’s usually not suitable for that type of file. It will then take the image and in some cases, the image will glitch in unfamiliar ways. I found this very interesting to take this and display it as a form of digital art, it puts a new perspective on the art world.
