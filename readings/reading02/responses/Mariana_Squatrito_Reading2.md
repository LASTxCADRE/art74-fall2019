Reading Response to Glitch Art 

  Thoughts on Glitch Art describes the process of glitch art and defines it as a new approach to Media. I loved the quote, “take a familiar piece of tech and do something unfamiliar with it”. I feel that that idea relates across mediums and that all artists are attempting to do something “unfamiliar” to the familiar. 
  
  My first impression of the text was that it had a sort of high energy as if it were rushed, and therefore, I felt rushed as I was reading it. I found that this hyper agency suited the form of media that Nick Briz was discussing. Whenever I have encountered glitches, I have always felt as if it was the result of me moving to quickly or rushing my device. I found Briz’s idea, that a glitch in not an error from the machine, but an error created by the user, very insightful and it changed how I viewed glitches or computer malfunctions.  
  
  I related most to the discussion on experiencing the glitch, in order to understand the technology, rather than using it as a means to an end. I create work because of my love for the experience of making. As a ceramic artist, I have said many times that clay has an agenda and can often tell us (the potters) what it’s going to do instead of bending to our “will,” so to speak. The clay makes it's own shape taht informs our wiew of the material. The idea that technology can also lead the user in a certain direction corroborates this idea that our materials can shape our world view.
