The ideas and practices of Nick on Glitch Art are intriguing to me, and I personally believe that he has a strong point in
embracing and creating glitches nowadays because such events have been happening since the first day we began to depend 
on technology just to be able to get through the day. The manipulation of a piece of technology is a way to rebel against 
companies telling you what is okay to do and not okay when using electronic devices. Since electronic devices are starting to
become part of our every day use we have depended on others on how to properly use them without questioning its purpose,
and by creating our own glitches and manipulations we gain a little control over the devices instead the other way around.
i found interesting on how there are restrictions in some file formats, such as the formats Nick mentioned the Txt, Pdf, Doc, 
and Wwf; I was never consciously aware of these restrictions because I was too focus in what the formats allowed me to do 
instead on what it prevented me from doing. I agree that technology is not neutral, as long as there is a human being doing the 
programming because we all have our own internalized biases.
